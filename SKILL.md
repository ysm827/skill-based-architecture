# Skill-Based Architecture

Restructure oversized single-file Skills or scattered project rules into a well-organized Skill directory. Builds on the official minimal Agent Skill contract (`name` + `description`) and kicks in when a single small `SKILL.md` is no longer enough.

## When to Use

- A single SKILL.md exceeds ~150 lines, mixing rules, workflows, and background material
- Project rules are scattered across `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.claude/`, etc.
- User explicitly requests Skill-based architecture or rule consolidation

## When NOT to Use

- Very small projects (fewer than 3 rule/doc files)
- Temporary repos with no long-term maintenance needs
- Teams with a well-functioning documentation system who don't want to migrate

## Progressive Rigor

Grow only under pressure. Tiers: **Single-file** (`SKILL.md` only, < 3 topics) → **Folder-light** (`+ rules/`, 3–5 topics or 1 recurring workflow) → **Full** (`+ workflows/` + `references/` + thin shells; ≥ 3 routed tasks, gotcha log, or multi-harness repo). Upgrade triggers: SKILL.md body > 90 lines or description > 25 lines, same pitfall surfaces twice, a task needs step-by-step instructions, or two harnesses share routing. **Split by abstraction (骨架/肉)** when content tangles invariant design theory with current-code facts: abstract theory → `architecture/`, code maps → `references/`, house style → `conventions/`, per-module landmines → `gotchas/` (methodology stays in `rules/`). Downgrade when content shrinks. Details: [references/progressive-rigor.md](references/progressive-rigor.md).

## Target Structure

├── conventions/      # house style (肉) — naming, paths, commands, formats

```

Root entries (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`) → thin shells with a `routing.yaml` bootstrap, not duplicated route tables.
`.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` → Cursor registration entry (required for discovery). See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for templates.

## Core Principles

1. **Single concise entry** — `SKILL.md` keeps a dual budget: description ≤ 25 lines (trigger phrases + activation) + body ≤ 90 lines (navigation). It navigates, not exhausts. ✓ Check: smoke-test reports both separately; over either → split intent clusters / move detail to sub-files.
2. **One skill folder** — all formal docs under `skills/<name>/`, not scattered at repo root. ✓ Check: `ls *.md` at root shows only thin shells, not rule/workflow files.
3. **Rules ≠ Flows** — `rules/` for constraints, `workflows/` for procedures. ✓ Check: any numbered steps in `rules/`? Any "always/never" in `workflows/`? Either = mixing.
4. **Routing.yaml as source** — task routes live in `routing.yaml`; shells only say how to read it. ✓ Check: route changed without running sync/check? No → drift risk.
5. **Cursor registration entry** — `.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` must exist. ✓ Check: `ls .cursor/skills/` — missing = Cursor cannot discover the skill.
6. **Progressive Rigor** — three tiers (Single-file / Folder-light / Full); grow only under pressure — see [Progressive Rigor section above](#progressive-rigor) + [details](references/progressive-rigor.md). ✓ Check: can you name the specific pressure that forced the current tier? "It felt right" ≠ pressure.
7. **Description = coarse activation** — domain boundary + real user trigger phrases; never enumerate workflow keywords nor summarize a workflow's steps — a step-summary becomes a shortcut the agent runs instead of reading the body ([ref](references/layout.md#description-as-trigger-condition)). ✓ Check: (a) can Common Tasks change without rewriting the description? (b) does the description or any route label carry HOW an agent could act on without opening the body/workflow? "no" to (a) or "yes" to (b) → fix.
8. **Gotchas are highest-value** — maintain costly pitfalls actively; keep them discoverable. ✓ Check: is each high-cost gotcha reachable from a Common Tasks route, not only buried in `references/`?
9. **Progressive disclosure** — every loaded file needs an independent task-time reason; conditional content leaves the startup read set, and files every real caller co-loads should merge unless ownership/generation requires separate storage. ✓ Check: for each route read, can you name a request that needs it now and a next action it changes? No → conditionally route, merge, or remove it.
10. **Task Execution + Closure** — after routing, one clear action/check executes directly; otherwise establish a Task Anchor (Goal + Done When + optional Boundaries), present it proportionally instead of dumping a fixed chat template, use the harness-native Plan without repeating visible steps, and run a compact Anchor Checkpoint before every main step so evidence—not drift—advances the task, then enter Task Closure ([ref](references/protocols.md#task-execution-protocol)). Workflow remains the domain procedure; Plan is only this Session's runtime instance, with no planning-file persistence. ✓ Check: immediately before the current step, can you name the Goal, remaining Done When evidence, step check, and Closure proof without replacing or skipping the matched Workflow?
11. **Durable-record rule** — generic records generalize across projects; business global models stay project-specific but must survive implementation replacement ([ref](references/protocols.md#generalization-rule)). ✓ Check: use the destination's test—cross-project pattern or cross-implementation business truth—without mixing code details into either.
12. **Self-maintenance** — line counts signal evaluation, not automatic action. Split only for independently selected tasks; merge files universally co-loaded/co-changed unless ownership or generation explains the boundary. ✓ Check: can the before/after load matrix prove less irrelevant reading without losing definitions, conditions, boundaries, or reasons?
13. **Activation over storage** — content in `references/` alone is not "captured"; it must be on the task path **and change what the agent does when read**. Reached-but-inert (correct, on-route, yet the agent would have proceeded identically without it) is a distinct failure from absent or unreachable — and no structural gate (orphan / route-reachability / smoke-test) can see it, only judgment can. ✓ Check: (a) trace the normal route — Agent hits the entry without hunting? (b) does hitting it change the next action — a file it now reads, a check it now runs, a step it now skips? "no" to either → stored, not activated.
14. **Token efficiency** — Always-read stays 2–3 files; domain files via Common Tasks only. ✓ Check: Always Read > 3 entries? Demote lowest-frequency.
15. **Rationalizations Table** — captures verbatim excuses from real pressure-test failures, organic or proven by a [baseline run](references/scenario-testing.md) before shipping ([ref](templates/skill/workflows/task-closure.md#rationalizations-to-reject), [Phase 9](workflows/full-migration.md#phase-9-pressure-test-the-skill)). ✓ Check: every row traces to a real failure — no failure observed and unwilling to baseline it → imagined-pain, drop it.
16. **Response discipline** — output short, precise, direct answers; avoid process narration, self-congratulation, gratuitous confirmations, and requirement restatement. Correct objective errors neutrally; do not infer user stance. ✓ Check: does each sentence serve the explicit request? No → delete it.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Missing Cursor registration entry** — Formal skill at `skills/<name>/` but no `.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` → Cursor never discovers the skill; all rules/workflows silently ignored
2. **Soft-pointer-only shell** — Thin shell says only "go read SKILL.md" without a `routing.yaml` bootstrap → instruction lost after context summarization in long conversations
3. **Vague / wrong-scope description** — Description is passive, wrong-language, too narrow ("fix bug" only), or bloated with every workflow keyword → skill misses natural requests or over-fires; keep description domain-level and route tasks in SKILL.md
4. **Stored but not activated — or activated but inert** — Costly pitfall recorded in `references/` but not surfaced in any workflow checklist or SKILL.md routing → future agents still miss it. Subtler form: it *is* on the route and gets read, but it's "correct but inert" — written as a background fact, not as a next action — so the agent reads it and proceeds unchanged. Reachable ≠ useful; the entry must change what the agent does, not merely be present and correct
5. **Task Closure Protocol skipped when it should have fired** — Agent considers itself "done" after main work and skips the 30-second AAR scan even though the Trigger Policy admitted the task (code/doc change happened) → lessons not captured. AAR is a completion gate when triggered, not an optional add-on. Pure Q&A / read-only tasks are correctly exempt — do not run AAR on them either
6. **Project-specific records** — Lessons written as project narratives ("in our product module, we found…") instead of reusable knowledge → useless outside current context; apply generalization rule before recording
7. **No SessionStart hook on long sessions** — `/clear` or `/compact` silently drops SKILL.md from context; agent loses all routing and protocol awareness without the user noticing → install SessionStart hook if your harness supports it (see [references/thin-shells.md § SessionStart Hook](references/thin-shells.md#sessionstart-hook-optional))
8. **Route skipping in multi-task sessions** — Agent reads SKILL.md for the first task, then skips re-reading for subsequent tasks in the same session ("I already know the rules"). New tasks may match different routes; context may have been compressed. Result: agent works from partial/stale memory, misses critical rules, debugs in wrong direction for hours → SKILL.md template ships a tiered Session Discipline (re-match the route every task; re-read files only on route-change or compaction — cheap re-match catches different routes without re-reading everything); all shells carry the trigger
9. **Missing or performative Task Anchor / long-task drift** — Agent starts a non-Simple task without a stable Goal/Done When, invents them only at the end, or dumps a fixed labeled block that duplicates the native Plan → use `templates/skill/workflows/task-execution.md`; keep the Anchor as runtime state, present only useful alignment, and run `reboot-check.md` before final validation/commit if the original constraints are no longer fresh
10. **Imagined-pain engineering** — Agent 提议加任何机制(规则/脚本/文件结构/模板章节)前没反问"这解决的是真痛点还是脑补":为未发生的失败加保险、为想象用户预建脚手架、为不存在的协议加 marker / 监控、给假设的"agent 偏差"立规矩。✓ Check:能给一个具体场景(file+line / commit / session)证明这事真发生过吗?给不出 → 不上。Historic: 5 ghost scripts (砍 2026-05-19), dossier schema (砍 2026-05-19), reflection-first mode shift (弃 2026-05-20), observations 日志 (拒上 2026-05-20)

# Reference — Protocols & Verification


## Meta-Workflow Templates

The canonical workflow templates live under `templates/skill/workflows/`. Every project should adopt at least these:

- [`update-rules.md`](../templates/skill/workflows/update-rules.md) — shared exit gate; covers rule sync, AAR, recording threshold, rule deprecation, post-update health check.
- [`maintain-docs.md`](../templates/skill/workflows/maintain-docs.md) — file health check, split, merge, and reference integrity.

For a higher-level orientation and the minimal starter scaffold, see [`TEMPLATES-GUIDE.md`](../TEMPLATES-GUIDE.md).

## Task Closure Protocol

Canonical source: [`templates/skill/workflows/update-rules.md`](../templates/skill/workflows/update-rules.md#task-closure-protocol).

This reference deliberately gives only the operating summary: task closure
applies only when the **Trigger Policy** admits the task (code or doc was
changed); for those tasks, closure means main-work verification, the 30-second
AAR scan, and any triggered recording, path-integrity, route-path, cross-
reference, behavior-validation, or external-fact checks. Keep the exact gate
wording and trigger table in `update-rules.md` so the protocol does not drift
across guide/reference copies.

**Pure Q&A, code explanation, read-only investigation, and advice with no file
changes are exempt** — do not enter the protocol, do not run AAR, do not run
`smoke-test.sh`. `smoke-test.sh` is a skill structure/routing/link validator,
not a default closure action for ordinary code changes or read-only work.

> **Reconcile tip (gate 3)**: before writing a recorded lesson, run `bash scripts/skill-asset where <keywords>` to surface existing sections that may already cover the topic. Avoids duplicate sections accumulating across files. See [`scripts/README.md`](../scripts/README.md) for `where` / `related` / `group` usage.

### AAR Scan Questions

1. Did this task reveal a recurring pitfall?
2. Was the debugging or design cost high?
3. Would a future agent miss this by reading code alone?
4. Did an existing rule turn out to be inaccurate or obsolete?
5. Did the task rely on an external fact that could have changed since the rule was written?

Skip the AAR entirely for: pure Q&A, code explanation, read-only investigation, advice with no file changes; formatting-only, comment-only, dependency-version-only, or behavior-preserving refactors.

## Recording Threshold

Record only when at least 2 of these 3 are true:

1. **Repeatable** — likely to recur in future work
2. **Costly** — missing it wastes meaningful time or causes real regressions
3. **Not obvious from code** — a future reader would not infer it quickly from implementation alone

Typical high-value records:

- framework lifecycle gotchas
- registration timing pitfalls
- hidden routing dependencies
- non-obvious synchronization or state reset requirements

Skip recording:

- one-off workarounds
- style preferences
- facts already obvious from existing code
- content already well covered by official docs and not project-specific

## Where To Record

Use the lightest useful destination:

- Stable constraint or convention → `rules/`
- Pitfall, lifecycle gotcha, architecture note, source index → `references/`
- Ordered task step or completion check → `workflows/`
- Task routing changed → `routing.yaml`, then `scripts/sync-routing.sh`
- Always-read set changed → `routing.yaml`, then `scripts/sync-routing.sh`
- Tool entry routing or Always Read changed → `routing.yaml`, then regenerate thin-shell generated blocks (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`)

Prefer appending to an existing file over creating a new one. Create a new file only when the topic is distinct enough to stay readable on its own.

## Recording Destination Guide

When the user explicitly asks to "record this", "remember this", or "save this for later", the agent must decide where to store the knowledge. Many AI tools (Claude Code, Gemini CLI) have their own memory systems (e.g., `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/`) that auto-load each session. These compete with the skill's documentation structure.

**Decision test:** "Would a different agent or person working on this same project benefit from this knowledge?"

| Answer | Destination | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Yes** — project-level knowledge | `skills/<name>/references/`, `rules/`, or `workflows/` | Technical patterns, conventions, pitfalls, architecture notes |
| **No** — personal/user-level knowledge | Agent's own memory system (`~/.claude/.../memory/`, etc.) | Communication preferences, personal shortcuts, user-specific context |

**Default to skill docs.** In practice, most "record this" requests during development are technical and project-scoped. The agent's own memory should only be used for content that is truly personal and would not help another contributor.

Apply the same recording threshold and generalization rule as AAR-initiated recordings — the destination changes, but the quality bar does not.

## Generalization Rule

Records must be reusable knowledge, not project-specific narratives. Before writing, check: would this record make sense in a different project of the same type? If it mentions specific module names or business terms without an abstract explanation, rewrite it.

Pattern: `specific finding → abstract as general pattern → state consequence of not following it`

For worked examples of good vs bad records, see [`templates/skill/workflows/update-rules.md`](../templates/skill/workflows/update-rules.md) (the canonical Generalization Rule section).

## When References Alone Are Not Enough

Recording a pitfall in `references/` preserves it, but does **not** guarantee a future task will read it.

If a lesson is both:

- **costly** enough to repeatedly waste meaningful time, and
- **task-relevant** to a recurring workflow such as fixing bugs, adding pages, adding renderers, or wiring multi-step integrations

then do **not** leave it buried in `references/` only. Also surface it in at least one activation path:

- add or update a completion check in the relevant `workflows/*.md`
- update `routing.yaml` so generated Common Tasks and thin-shell blocks point at the pitfall/reference file
- if the lesson is really a stable constraint, promote a concise summary into `rules/`

Rule of thumb:

- `references/` stores the explanation
- `workflows/` prevents omission at task closure
- `routing.yaml`-generated `SKILL.md` Always Read, Common Tasks, and thin-shell bootstraps make the right file more likely to be read

If a future agent could still miss the lesson while following the normal task path, the knowledge is stored but not yet activated.

## Skill Activation Verification

Phase 8 checks structural correctness, but doesn't verify the skill actually activates at runtime. Use these additional checks after migration.

### Description Quality Check

| Check | Pass criteria |
|---|---|
| Length | ≥ 20 words or ≥ 40 CJK characters |
| Trigger phrases | At least 2 quoted trigger phrases in the user's actual language(s) (e.g. "refactor project rules", "重构项目规则") |
| Format | Third-person: "This skill should be used when…" |
| Scope | Coarse domain / intent-cluster activation; not "helps with development" and not a list of every workflow |
| Specificity | Mentions concrete activation conditions, not just category labels |

A description that fails these checks may silently never fire — the skill exists but the Agent never picks it up.

Run `scripts/check-description-routing.sh` after editing frontmatter. It catches obvious over-broad descriptions, workflow keyword stuffing, duplicate quoted trigger phrases across multiple skills, and multiple `primary: true` skills.

### Routing Coverage Check

Verify that `SKILL.md` Common Tasks covers the project's actual task distribution:

1. List the 5–10 most common task types in the project
2. For each, confirm `routing.yaml` has a matching entry with correct file routing
3. If a common task is missing, add it — uncovered tasks fall through to the generic "Other" route and may miss important rules/references
4. Run `scripts/sync-routing.sh --check` so generated `SKILL.md` Always Read / Common Tasks and thin-shell blocks cannot drift

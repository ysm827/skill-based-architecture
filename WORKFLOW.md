# Migration Workflow

Step-by-step procedure for restructuring a long SKILL.md or scattered rules into Skill-based architecture.

## Quick Start

For small-to-medium projects, run the scaffold and fill in content. Skip the full 9-phase process.

### Which path should I take?

Answer these questions to decide:

1. **Is the total rule content > 150 lines across all files?** (Count SKILL.md + AGENTS.md + .cursor/rules/ + README rules sections combined, not just one file)
2. **Are rules duplicated across 2+ entry files?** (e.g., AGENTS.md and .cursor/rules/ overlap)
3. **Do you have recurring pitfalls that keep being rediscovered?** (same debugging lesson learned twice)

| Answers | Path |
|---------|------|
| All No | **Minimal single SKILL.md** — use the [minimal starter template](TEMPLATES-GUIDE.md#minimal-starter-template) |
| 1 Yes, others No | **Quick Start scaffold** below — run the script, fill TODOs |
| 2+ Yes | **Full 9-phase migration** — follow [`workflows/full-migration.md`](workflows/full-migration.md) |

If the project has only one small skill, no duplicated entry files, and no growing rule/reference sprawl yet, **do not force the full architecture immediately**. Start with a single well-written `SKILL.md` using the minimal starter template in [TEMPLATES-GUIDE.md](TEMPLATES-GUIDE.md), and upgrade only when one of the conditions above becomes true.

**Step 1 — Scaffold from pre-built templates.** Don't regenerate file bodies inline — the upstream ships byte-for-byte files under [`templates/`](templates/). Copy them into the target project and run a single `sed` pass.

```bash
# Assumes skill-based-architecture is cloned as a sibling, or $UPSTREAM points at it.
UPSTREAM="${UPSTREAM:-../skill-based-architecture}"
NAME="<name>"          # project identifier, kebab-case
SUMMARY="<one-line project summary>"

# 1) Copy skill tree: templates/skill/ → skills/$NAME/
mkdir -p "skills/$NAME"
cp -R "$UPSTREAM/templates/skill/." "skills/$NAME/"
mv "skills/$NAME/SKILL.md.template" "skills/$NAME/SKILL.md"

# 2) Copy entry shells to repo root (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, CODEX.md, GEMINI.md, .cursor/)
cp -R "$UPSTREAM/templates/shells/." .

# 3) Cursor registration entry: materialize SKILL.md, then rename the {{NAME}} placeholder directory
mv ".cursor/skills/{{NAME}}/SKILL.md.template" ".cursor/skills/{{NAME}}/SKILL.md"
mv ".cursor/skills/{{NAME}}" ".cursor/skills/$NAME"

# 4) Substitute mechanical placeholders (macOS sed syntax; on Linux drop the '' after -i)
find "skills/$NAME" AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md CODEX.md GEMINI.md .codex .cursor \
  -type f \( -name '*.md' -o -name '*.mdc' \) \
  -exec sed -i '' \
    -e "s/{{NAME}}/$NAME/g" \
    -e "s/{{SUMMARY}}/$SUMMARY/g" \
    {} +

# 5) (Optional) install hooks — router restore, workflow-state hints, behavior gate
# mkdir -p .claude/hooks
# cp "$UPSTREAM/templates/hooks/session-start" .claude/hooks/session-start
# cp "$UPSTREAM/templates/hooks/workflow-state" .claude/hooks/workflow-state
# cp "$UPSTREAM/templates/hooks/agent-behavior-gate.sh" .claude/hooks/agent-behavior-gate.sh
# chmod +x .claude/hooks/session-start .claude/hooks/workflow-state .claude/hooks/agent-behavior-gate.sh
# test -f .claude/settings.json || cp "$UPSTREAM/templates/hooks/hooks.json" .claude/settings.json
# # If settings exists, merge the top-level "hooks" object instead.

# 6) Done — scaffold equivalent to completing Phases 3–7 in one pass
echo "✅ Scaffold created at skills/$NAME/"
echo "Next: fill every <!-- FILL: --> marker with real project content, then run smoke-test.sh for Phase 8."
echo "If this step fails partway through, run: rm -rf skills/$NAME .cursor/skills/$NAME && rerun this script."
```

**Why copy instead of generate?** Inline heredoc generation lost sections under pressure (Auto-Triggers dropped, routing tables mangled, description field left as trigger-phrase-less boilerplate). The `templates/` tree is the single source of truth — see [`templates/README.md`](templates/README.md) for byte budgets, placeholder conventions, and the "would two real projects disagree?" admission test. Template source files use `SKILL.md.template` so skill loaders do not treat them as real skills when this repo is installed; Quick Start renames them into real `SKILL.md` files after copying.

**Step 1.5 — Profile the project before filling content.** Follow `skills/$NAME/workflows/profile-project.md` (copied from `templates/skill/workflows/profile-project.md`) before writing project-specific `<!-- FILL: -->` content. Start with a user brainstorm gate: ask whether the user wants to brainstorm the target project's purpose, modules, common tasks, boundaries, and known pitfalls.

- If the user says yes / "没问题" / otherwise agrees: **do not read code yet**. First run the brainstorm, restate a short calibrated summary, and ask the user to correct or confirm it.
- Treat user feedback as **calibration input**, not verified fact. Use it to check whether your initial summary is aligned, then read local code/config to verify it.
- After the brainstorm feedback, inspect real evidence (README, build files, CI, entry points, configs, module layout, tests) and classify conclusions as `Confirmed from code/config`, `User-calibrated`, `Inferred`, or `Unknown`.
- Only then write project content into `rules/`, `workflows/`, `references/`, and `SKILL.md`. `rules/` and procedural `workflows/` must come from confirmed evidence, not brainstorm-only claims.
- If the user declines brainstorming or explicitly asks to skip it, proceed with code-first evidence scanning and mark unclear conclusions as `Unknown` instead of guessing.

**Step 2 — Fill content.** Two kinds of placeholders, two different mechanisms:

| Marker | How to fill |
|---|---|
| `{{NAME}}`, `{{SUMMARY}}` | Done by the `sed` pass in Step 1 |
| `<!-- FILL: … -->` | Requires judgment — you must read each marker and write real project content |

Run this to list every pending FILL:

```bash
grep -rn 'FILL:' "skills/$NAME" AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md CODEX.md GEMINI.md .cursor
```

Every hit is mandatory. A skill with unfilled FILL markers will silently fail to activate (agents read generic trigger phrases and never match user intent).

Always Read lists, Common Tasks, and shell bootstraps are generated from `skills/$NAME/routing.yaml`. Edit that manifest, then run:

```bash
bash "skills/$NAME/scripts/sync-routing.sh" "$NAME"
```

Do not hand-edit generated Always Read / Common Tasks in `SKILL.md` or generated blocks in thin shells.

**Step 3 — Verify.** After all FILLs are resolved, run the automated smoke test:

```bash
# Fully automated — checks structure, routing, placeholders, line budgets, and description quality
bash "skills/$NAME/scripts/smoke-test.sh" "$NAME"

# Routing manifest drift check (also run by smoke-test when routing.yaml exists)
bash "skills/$NAME/scripts/sync-routing.sh" "$NAME" --check

# (Optional) Surface rules/ or references/ files with zero inbound links
(cd "skills/$NAME" && bash scripts/audit-orphans.sh)
```

`smoke-test.sh` covers everything: file existence, line count budgets, placeholder/FILL residue, description word count / trigger phrases / keyword-stuffing, routing-manifest drift, routing completeness (parses Common Tasks and verifies every referenced file exists), description consistency between SKILL.md and Cursor entry, shell bootstrap consistency, SessionStart-hook presence, broken markdown links, and content conformance (§9, when a `conformance.yaml` exists). Zero manual input needed.

For description-quality judgment (too narrow / weak or off-language trigger phrases) — re-read the `description` block aloud and check it uses the user's actual phrasing. `smoke-test.sh` now WARNs on the over-broad / keyword-stuffed case (> 12 quoted phrases), but no script substitutes for the rest of that judgment.

For complex migrations (large projects, heavily scattered rules), follow [`workflows/full-migration.md`](workflows/full-migration.md) for the Phase 1–9 process.

## If a Phase Crashes

Migration is a one-shot operation. If the shell exits mid-`sed`, `/compact` fires, or the laptop reboots, **don't** rerun from Phase 1 on a half-templated tree — placeholder residue and partial files will produce misleading phase passes.

```bash
rm -rf skills/$NAME .cursor/skills/$NAME
# then rerun the Quick Start scaffold from the top
```

Use `bash skills/$NAME/scripts/smoke-test.sh $NAME --phase N` to verify a specific phase before moving on (the full smoke test only passes after Phase 8). Phase 9 is a manual attestation: at least one row in `workflows/task-closure.md` § Rationalizations to Reject came from a real pressure test.

## Upgrading an Existing Downstream Project

When upstream releases new templates, hooks, scripts, or workflow improvements, do **not** re-migrate. Use the agent-led upstream refresh path documented at [`workflows/upgrade-downstream.md`](workflows/upgrade-downstream.md). The user just says "上游项目更新了,帮我更新一下" or "update from upstream", and the agent follows `skills/<name>/workflows/update-upstream.md`.

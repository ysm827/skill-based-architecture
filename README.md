**English** | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A **lifecycle framework for AI-agent rule systems.** Turns scattered prompt documents (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/`, README rules) into routable, verifiable, updatable engineering assets under `skills/<name>/`.

It focuses on the rule system itself: structure, routing, workflows, validation, after-action learning, and upstream/downstream updates. It does **not** ship technology-specific rules — those belong in your downstream project skill.

## What it produces

```
scattered project guidance
AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / .cursor/rules / README notes
        │
        ▼
skills/<project>/
├── SKILL.md          # router: description ≤ 25 + body ≤ 90 lines (dual budget)
├── rules/            # stable constraints
├── workflows/        # repeatable procedures
├── references/       # architecture, gotchas, indexes
└── docs/             # optional reports and prompts

tool entry files
AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / CODEX.md / GEMINI.md / .cursor/rules / .codex
        └── thin shells: route to skills/<project>/, no duplicated rule bodies
```

## Why

| Symptom | What goes wrong |
|---|---|
| Single `SKILL.md` with 400+ lines | Agent reads everything every task — wastes tokens, hides what matters |
| Rules duplicated across `AGENTS.md`, `.cursor/rules/`, `CLAUDE.md` | Drift, contradictions, no source of truth |
| Skill activation is unreliable | Description is a passive summary instead of explicit trigger conditions |
| Hard-won lessons buried in docs | Costly pitfalls never surface during the next task |
| Rule files only grow, never shrink | Useful rules get buried by obsolete ones |

The architecture answers each: a routing source-of-truth (`routing.yaml`), thin shells everywhere else, description-as-trigger discipline, AAR with a recording threshold, and self-maintenance via line-count signals + split/merge procedures.

## When NOT to use

- Total rule content < 50 lines (a single `CLAUDE.md` is enough)
- Single harness, no team sharing, no recurring tasks
- Short-lived solo project (< 2 weeks)

Start with a plain `CLAUDE.md` or `.cursor/rules/workflow.mdc`; upgrade later when content sprawls. [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) has a Quick Start path for that upgrade.

## Quick Start

### 1. Make this meta-skill available locally

Pull this repo **any way you want** (`git clone`, download zip, submodule, fork…) to **any location** — the only requirement is that **you and the agent both know where it lives**.

As long as the agent can locate this directory when triggered, the path doesn't matter. If it isn't on the agent's default search path (e.g., Cursor's `~/.cursor/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, or the project's own `skills/`), write the path into `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `.cursor/rules/` so the agent can find it.

Common placements:

- Inside the project: `skills/skill-based-architecture/`
- Next to the project: `../skill-based-architecture/`
- Cursor user-level: `~/.cursor/skills/skill-based-architecture/`
- Cursor project-level: `.cursor/skills/skill-based-architecture/`

Example (clone inside the project):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WoJiSama/skill-based-architecture.git \
  skills/skill-based-architecture
```

### 2. Trigger it from the target project

Ask the agent to use the local meta-skill:

> "Use skill-based-architecture to refactor the project rules"

Equivalent triggers: "Organize the project rules", "Migrate rules to skills/", "整理项目规则".

The agent then copies the pre-built scaffold from [`templates/`](templates/) into `skills/<name>/`, creates the thin shells, fills every `<!-- FILL: -->` marker, and runs validation. Full procedure: [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md).

### 3. (Codex only) Manually request sub-agent / parallel work

Several workflows in this meta-skill lean on sub-agent delegation and parallel agent fan-out (see [`templates/skill/workflows/subagent-driven.md`](templates/skill/workflows/subagent-driven.md) and [`templates/skill/workflows/refactor-fanout.md`](templates/skill/workflows/refactor-fanout.md)). In most harnesses the in-repo rules are enough — the agent decides on its own when to fan out.

**Codex is the exception.** Its runtime imposes a tool-level rule on `spawn_agent`: it may only be invoked when the user **explicitly** asks for sub-agent, delegation, or parallel agent work. That tool-level rule outranks anything in this repo's `AGENTS.md` or skill files, so the fan-out patterns will **not** fire automatically — even though the workflow documents tell the agent to use them.

If you're in Codex and want the delegation to actually happen, say so in the trigger sentence:

> "Use skill-based-architecture to refactor the project rules; **spawn sub-agents in parallel** for the fan-out steps the workflow describes."

Equivalent phrasings: "delegate via parallel sub-agents", "use sub-agents for this", "并行 sub-agent 处理 fan-out 部分".

## Key features

- **Two-layer routing.** `SKILL.md` keeps a short generated **Always Read** list; **Common Tasks** routes the agent to extra files only when needed. `routing.yaml` is the editable source of truth in downstream projects.
- **Thin shells with routing bootstrap.** Every entry file embeds a short bootstrap that points to `routing.yaml`. The route table is not duplicated across shells; natural-language-only instructions get lost during context summarization.
- **Description as trigger condition.** Domain-level activation phrases in the user's actual language(s), not workflow keyword stuffing. Re-read aloud after edits — no script substitutes for hearing whether it sounds like a real user.
- **Session Discipline + Task Closure.** Re-read SKILL.md on every new task in the same session; finish non-trivial tasks with a 30-second AAR scan + recording threshold, never "tests passed = done".
- **Self-maintenance.** Line-count signals trigger evaluation, not automatic action; split/merge procedures and freshness checks keep docs lean.
- **Cross-harness.** Compatible with Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Windsurf, Gemini, OpenCode, and AGENTS.md-based tools.

| Tool | Required entry |
|---|---|
| **Cursor** | `.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` + `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` |
| **Claude Code** | `CLAUDE.md` (optional `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` stub) |
| **Codex CLI / Copilot CLI / OpenCode / other** | `AGENTS.md` |
| **Windsurf** | `.windsurf/rules/*.md` or shared `AGENTS.md` |
| **Gemini CLI** | `GEMINI.md` |

All entries must contain a `routing.yaml` bootstrap — for Claude Code native skills, prefer project-specific names (`<project>-review`) since enterprise > personal > project precedence resolves same-name skills.

Per-tool templates: [`references/per-tool-shells.md`](references/per-tool-shells.md). Tool compatibility deep dive: same file.

## FAQ

**Does this replace the official Anthropic skill template?**
No. The official template defines the *minimal* skill shape (a folder with SKILL.md + frontmatter). This meta-skill starts one level later — it adds structure when a single small SKILL.md is no longer enough.

**Can I migrate incrementally?**
Yes. Round 1: extract rules. Round 2: extract workflows. Round 3: extract references and create thin shells. Each round leaves the project in a working state.

**How do downstream projects receive upstream improvements?**
Ask the agent to update from upstream. The copied `workflows/update-upstream.md` clones the latest upstream, reads `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md` from the cloned repo, compares files itself, patches in mechanism changes, preserves project-owned content, and re-runs validation including conformance against upstream's own contract.

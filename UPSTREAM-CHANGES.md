# Upstream Changes

This file is a human- and agent-readable map for downstream refreshes.
When a downstream project asks to update from this upstream repo, read the
latest relevant entries first, then verify every candidate change against the
actual upstream/downstream file diff.

This is not a lockfile, upgrade manifest, changelog contract, or source of
truth. It is intentionally upstream-owned only. Downstream projects should not
copy, create, or maintain a local version of this file.

## How To Use

1. Clone the upstream repo named in `workflows/update-upstream.md`.
2. Read the newest entries below to identify likely files and intent.
3. Compare actual upstream and downstream files before editing.
4. Preserve downstream project-owned rules, gotchas, routing examples, and
   local workflows.
5. Patch useful upstream mechanism changes, then run the downstream validation
   commands from `workflows/update-upstream.md`.

## Entry Format

```text
## YYYY-MM-DD - short title

- Upstream commit: <hash> <subject>
- Changed areas: <files or directories>
- Why it matters: <intent>
- Downstream refresh guidance: <what to compare/port/preserve>
```

## Archive Policy

Downstream refresh agents almost always only read the most recent 3–5 entries. Old entries cost them context without changing decisions. When this file passes ~300 lines (or roughly 8 entries), move the oldest entries to `UPSTREAM-CHANGES-archive.md` and keep only the most recent 3–5 here.

The archive file has the same format and is read on demand if a downstream agent is investigating a specific historical change. `scripts/check-upstream-changes.sh` only enforces a same-diff entry in `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md`; archived entries are out of its scope.

## 2026-05-09 - Bloat reduction across templates, references, examples, READMEs

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas: 33 files. Deletions:
  `templates/migration/` (entire dir — `migrate.sh`, `resume.sh`, README),
  `templates/checklists/post-migration.md`,
  `templates/protocol-blocks/iron-law-header.md`,
  `templates/shells/.codex/instructions.md`, `.codex/instructions.md` (root),
  `examples/{migration,project-types,self-evolution,README}.md`.
  Major slims: `WORKFLOW.md` (-160 lines, removed migration FSM),
  `README.md` + `README.zh-CN.md` (-296 lines combined),
  `references/layout.md` (-167 lines, split out three new files),
  `references/thin-shells.md` (-141 lines, per-tool moved out).
  New references: `references/{progressive-rigor,positioning,per-tool-shells}.md`.
  Major rewrite: `EXAMPLES.md` (now consolidated body, was a stub).
  Mechanism updates: `scripts/sync-self-routing.sh` and
  `templates/skill/scripts/sync-routing.sh` no longer generate
  `.codex/instructions.md`; `smoke-test.sh` makes `.codex/instructions.md`
  optional instead of required; `examples/README.md` route in
  `references/self-hosting-routing.yaml` repointed to `EXAMPLES.md` +
  `examples/behavior-failures.md`.
  Net: +476 / −2117 lines.
- Why it matters: removed mechanisms that solved problems that don't
  recur — the migration state machine for crashes that don't happen, the
  duplicate Codex shell for harnesses that all read `AGENTS.md`, four
  long examples files that no route ever activated, the reusable
  `iron-law-header` block that was referenced once. Split two oversized
  references (`layout.md`, `thin-shells.md`) so routing pulls only the
  relevant subsection. The architecture's own "small focused files"
  principle now applies to itself.
- Downstream refresh guidance: when running `update-upstream`, expect to
  delete several files in your downstream skill if you scaffolded from a
  prior upstream:
  - Delete `skills/$NAME/.codex/instructions.md` if your harness does not
    explicitly read it (most don't — `AGENTS.md` is canonical).
    `smoke-test.sh` no longer requires it.
  - If your downstream copied `templates/migration/`, `templates/checklists/`,
    or `templates/protocol-blocks/iron-law-header.md`, remove them — they
    are no longer maintained upstream.
  - Old long-form example files were consolidated into root `EXAMPLES.md`.
    `examples/behavior-failures.md` is the only example file kept.
  - For inbound links to former `references/layout.md` sections,
    repoint: `#progressive-rigor` → `progressive-rigor.md`,
    `#multi-skill-projects` → `multi-skill-routing.md` (Coexistence rules),
    Positioning section → `positioning.md`.
  - For inbound links to former `references/thin-shells.md § Per-Tool …`,
    repoint to `references/per-tool-shells.md`.

## 2026-05-09 - Wire conformance into the check suite + self-hosting parity

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas: `scripts/check-all.sh`,
  `templates/skill/workflows/update-upstream.md`,
  `references/self-hosting-conformance.yaml` (new),
  `references/README.md`, `scripts/README.md`, `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md`
- Why it matters: closes three follow-on gaps that were left by the previous
  conformance commit:
  1. The conformance check shipped without being wired into `check-all.sh` —
     it was a "stored but not activated" tool (Pitfall #4 in `SKILL.md`).
     Now `check-all.sh` runs both the template manifest and the new
     self-hosting manifest before commit/push.
  2. The downstream `update-upstream` workflow ran the local
     `conformance.yaml` (a snapshot from initial scaffold), which silently
     re-validates against an old contract whenever upstream bumps required
     sections. The workflow now mandates running the check against
     `$tmp/upstream/templates/skill/conformance.yaml` (the live upstream
     contract) and only after passing may the local manifest be overwritten
     as a mechanism-owned file.
  3. The upstream repo itself was outside the conformance net — it is
     self-hosting and has no `workflows/` folder, so the template manifest
     could not validate it. The new
     `references/self-hosting-conformance.yaml` asserts the upstream's
     canonical files (`SKILL.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`, `TEMPLATES-GUIDE.md`,
     `references/protocols.md`) still teach the protocols its templates
     promise downstream — Task Closure Protocol, AAR, Recording Threshold,
     Activation Check, Generalization Rule, Progressive Rigor, etc.
  Additionally `scripts/README.md` now carries a Check Suite Matrix so
  maintainers can answer "which check covers which gap" without reading
  every script header.
- Downstream refresh guidance: when running `update-upstream`, follow the
  updated step 9 (run conformance against the upstream clone's manifest, not
  the local one). Treat `conformance.yaml` and `_parse_conformance.py` as
  mechanism-owned — overwrite them from upstream after a successful refresh.
  Do NOT copy `references/self-hosting-conformance.yaml` or `check-all.sh`
  into downstream projects; they are upstream-only maintenance assets.

## 2026-05-09 - Content conformance manifest + check script

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas: `templates/skill/conformance.yaml` (new),
  `templates/skill/scripts/check-version-conformance.sh` (new),
  `templates/skill/scripts/_parse_conformance.py` (new),
  `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md`
- Why it matters: adds a content-presence check that complements the existing
  guardrails. `check-upstream-changes.sh` enforces a downstream-impact note,
  `sync-routing.sh --check` keeps routing tables in sync, `smoke-test.sh`
  enforces structural budgets, `check-self-scenarios.sh` proves trigger
  routing, and `check-growth-health.sh` reports growth pressure. None of
  those validate that a downstream skill actually carries the workflow
  sections an upstream upgrade just shipped (Task Closure Protocol,
  Generalization Rule, Question Gate A/B/C, the dossier-folder block, and so
  on). The new manifest closes that gap: each commit IS the version, and
  `check-version-conformance.sh <skill-root>` asserts the listed sections /
  phrases / files all exist. Default manifest path is
  `<skill-root>/conformance.yaml`; downstream skills get a copy when they
  scaffold from `templates/skill/`. Upstream self-check:
  `bash templates/skill/scripts/check-version-conformance.sh templates/skill`.
- Downstream refresh guidance: when running `update-upstream`, after the
  existing routing sync and smoke test, run the conformance check on your
  skill root. If it reports missing sections, the upstream upgrade is
  incomplete — re-apply the missing template content before declaring the
  refresh done. Do NOT add `version:` fields to `conformance.yaml`; each
  upstream commit is the version, and downstream pulls the latest manifest
  from the upstream clone.

## 2026-05-08 - Architecture governance follow-through

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas: `templates/skill/workflows/profile-project.md`,
  `references/layout.md`, `references/executable-skill-architecture.md`,
  `references/scenario-testing.md`, `TEMPLATES-GUIDE.md`,
  `references/protocols.md`, `templates/skill/workflows/update-rules.md`,
  `templates/README.md`, `templates/skill/scripts/check-growth-health.sh`,
  `templates/skill/scripts/audit-route-paths.sh`,
  `scripts/check-self-scenarios.sh`, `scripts/check-all.sh`, `README.md`,
  `README.zh-CN.md`, `skill.yaml`, and `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md`
- Why it matters: turns the architecture review into concrete governance:
  project profiling now uses separate structure / execution / topology axes,
  growth pressure is reported without failing by default, Task Closure has one
  canonical source, references can be audited by route path, and the
  self-hosting repo has minimal scenario checks for high-risk routing.
- Downstream refresh guidance: port the three-axis `profile-project` changes
  and the new report scripts if the downstream skill is starting to grow. Keep
  `check-growth-health.sh` and `audit-route-paths.sh` report-first unless the
  downstream project has stable thresholds. Do not copy
  `scripts/check-self-scenarios.sh`; it is upstream self-hosting validation.

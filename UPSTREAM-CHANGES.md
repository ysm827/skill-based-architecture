# Upstream Changes

This file is a human- and agent-readable map for downstream refreshes.
When a downstream project asks to update from this upstream repo, read the
latest relevant entries first, then verify every candidate change against the
actual upstream/downstream file diff.

This is not a lockfile, upgrade manifest, changelog contract, or source of
truth. It is intentionally upstream-owned only. Downstream projects should not
copy, create, or maintain a local version of this file.

## How To Use

1. Clone the upstream repo named in `workflows/update-upstream.md`.
2. Read the newest entries below to identify likely files and intent.
3. Compare actual upstream and downstream files before editing.
4. Preserve downstream project-owned rules, gotchas, routing examples, and
   local workflows.
5. Patch useful upstream mechanism changes, then run the downstream validation
   commands from `workflows/update-upstream.md`.

## Entry Format

```text
## YYYY-MM-DD - short title

- Status: superseded by YYYY-MM-DD - newer-title    # OPTIONAL — see below
- Upstream commit: <hash> <subject>
- Changed areas: <files or directories>
- Why it matters: <intent>
- Downstream refresh guidance: <what to compare/port/preserve>
```

### Status field (optional)

Default = active (omit the `Status:` line). Add it only when an entry's guidance has been **reversed** (not merely extended) by a later commit:

- `Status: superseded by YYYY-MM-DD - <title>` — newer entry replaces this guidance. Downstream refresh agents follow the newer entry, skip this one.
- `Status: deprecated — <one-line reason>` — the mechanism this entry describes was removed entirely; no replacement exists. The entry stays as history.

**Writer protocol.** When your new entry reverses an older one — active or archived — edit the older entry to add the `Status: superseded by ...` line referencing your new entry's heading. Pointers are one-way (older → newer); the new entry can mention the supersede in prose but doesn't carry machine markup. Extending or building on a prior entry does **not** count as reversal — only reach for `superseded by` when reading the old guidance would lead a future agent astray.

**Check.** `scripts/check-upstream-supersedes.sh` (wired into `check-all.sh`) validates every `Status: superseded by` reference resolves to a real `## YYYY-MM-DD - title` heading in `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md` or `UPSTREAM-CHANGES-archive.md`. Broken references fail the suite.

## Archive Policy

Downstream refresh agents almost always only read the most recent 3–5 entries. Old entries cost them context without changing decisions. When this file passes ~300 lines (or roughly 8 entries), move the oldest entries to `UPSTREAM-CHANGES-archive.md` and keep only the most recent 3–5 here.

The archive file has the same format and is read on demand if a downstream agent is investigating a specific historical change. `scripts/check-upstream-changes.sh` only enforces a same-diff entry in `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md`; archived entries are out of its scope.

## 2026-06-08 - Subagent verification patterns: adversarial verify + loop-until-dry

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas:
  - **NEW `templates/skill/references/subagent-verification.md`** — two
    harness-agnostic patterns that extend `subagent-driven.md`'s two-stage
    review from *worker compliance* to *output correctness + discovery
    completeness*: (1) **adversarial verification** — for an uncertain finding
    (bug / security / research claim), dispatch N independent verifiers each
    contracted to *refute* it, default-to-refuted, keep only on majority
    survival; perspective-diverse variant gives each verifier a distinct lens.
    (2) **loop-until-dry** — for open-ended discovery (no known task-list size),
    dispatch finder rounds, dedup against all-seen, stop after K empty rounds;
    multi-modal rounds + no-silent-caps. Both carry an explicit "when NOT to
    reach for these" (mechanically-checkable output or bounded task list → the
    existing single review is enough).
  - `templates/skill/workflows/subagent-driven.md` — Phase 3 (Two-Stage Review)
    gains a one-line pointer to the new reference for the judgment / discovery
    case (compliance review necessary but not sufficient).
- Why it matters: the existing subagent surface (`subagent-driven.md`,
  `refactor-fanout.md`) is built for **decomposable known work** and reviews
  **worker compliance** (did it follow the contract). It had no pattern for the
  case where the worker's *conclusion* may be plausible-but-wrong, or where the
  problem has *no known size* — exactly the gap a multi-agent "exhaustive mode"
  fills. Distilled to the two harness-agnostic patterns; the harness-specific
  orchestration API (Claude Code's `Workflow` / parallel-`Task` fan-out
  primitives) is deliberately **excluded** per `ANTI-TEMPLATES.md` § "Subagent
  type registries / harness-specific dispatch code" — predefining one harness's
  dispatch API would lie to every other harness.
- Downstream refresh guidance: copy `references/subagent-verification.md` whole
  (project-agnostic) and add the Phase 3 pointer line to your local
  `subagent-driven.md`. No `routing.yaml` or `conformance.yaml` change required
  — these are optional optimization patterns, not safety contracts (same posture
  as `refactor-fanout.md`). On harnesses with no parallel / background dispatch,
  the patterns degrade to sequential verifier passes — you keep the adversarial /
  loop discipline, you lose the parallelism. If your project has never needed
  adversarial verification or open-ended discovery, skip the file and re-pull
  when the situation actually appears.

## 2026-06-08 - smoke-test.sh: activate hook / stuffing / conformance checks

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas:
  - `templates/skill/scripts/smoke-test.sh` — three new checks, all closing
    gaps where a real downstream (`chaos`) drifted while passing the old
    smoke-test:
    - **1d SessionStart hook (WARN)** — when `.claude/` exists but no
      `SessionStart` hook is wired in `.claude/settings*.json`, warn (Pitfall
      #7: routing silently drops after `/clear` or `/compact`). Never fails —
      harness-dependent.
    - **4c-stuffing (WARN)** — description with > `$DESCRIPTION_MAX_TRIGGERS`
      (default 12) quoted phrases is flagged as workflow-keyword stuffing
      (Pitfall #3 / Principle #7). The old check only caught *too few* (< 2)
      quoted phrases; this catches *too many*.
    - **Section 9 Content Conformance (FAIL)** — if a `conformance.yaml` exists,
      run `check-version-conformance.sh` so the one check people run after every
      change also catches *content* drift (e.g. a renamed "Task Closure
      Protocol"). Skipped silently when no manifest. Runs in full / `--phase 8`
      only — not in `--phase 7`, so `check-all` self-hosting verify is unaffected.
  - `templates/skill/scripts/check-growth-health.sh` — raised `smoke-test.sh`
    soft cap 850 → 900 (the verifier legitimately grew by the three checks above).
- Why it matters: structural checks (files exist, links resolve, routing in sync)
  were gated and ran easily; the checks that catch hook/description/content drift
  existed but were manual ("stored, not activated"). A downstream passed
  smoke-test green while missing its hook, stuffing its description to 25 quoted
  phrases, and regressing a conformance-required phrase. These three additions
  move those checks onto the path that actually runs.
- Downstream refresh guidance: re-vendor `smoke-test.sh` and
  `check-growth-health.sh` from this upstream. §9 depends on the conformance
  checker, so re-vendor `check-version-conformance.sh` + `_parse_conformance.py`
  as a coupled set (if `conformance.yaml` is present but the checker is missing,
  §9 now WARNs rather than silently skipping). After re-vendoring, run
  `bash skills/<name>/scripts/smoke-test.sh <name>` (full, so §9 runs) — new
  WARNs/FAILs surface pre-existing drift; fix them (wire a SessionStart hook,
  trim the description, re-add any conformance-required phrase) rather than
  suppressing the checks. In multi-skill repos the §1d hook check is skill-aware:
  it only passes when a hook re-injects THIS skill's `skills/<name>/` router.
- Known remaining gap (by design, not yet closed): the hook (§1d) and stuffing
  (§4c) checks are WARN-only (harness-dependent / judgment), so re-drift of P1/P3
  is detected but non-blocking; only conformance (§9) is FAIL-gated. And
  smoke-test is still human/agent-triggered — no pre-commit or CI auto-runs it
  downstream. Pick a gate (pre-commit, closure-step, or periodic update-upstream)
  per project; a `SMOKE_STRICT=1` promote-WARNs-to-FAIL mode can be added when a
  CI consumer exists.

## 2026-06-05 - route-health.sh: static routing-quality lint (Tier 1)

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas:
  - `templates/skill/scripts/route-health.sh` (NEW) — static routing-QUALITY lint.
    Complements (does not duplicate) sync-routing.sh: sync-routing validates STRUCTURE
    (missing files, schema, missing `other`); route-health flags QUALITY SMELLS it
    doesn't — routes that can't match well: no/weak `trigger_examples` (<2), trigger
    overlap (discriminating-token intersection, df==2 so project/domain words are
    ignored), and language mismatch (English-only triggers in a CJK-dominant skill, or
    vice versa). Pure static read of routing.yaml; no usage data, no logging, no file
    written; advisory (exit 0). Does NOT catch time-drift (needs a Tier 2 usage miner).
  - Wired as advisory into activation points that already fire (not per task, no
    timer): `task-closure.md` path-integrity gate (when routing changed),
    `update-upstream.md` validate step, `profile-project.md` + `maintain-docs.md`
    checklists.
- Why it matters: footprint.sh measures routing COST; nothing measured routing
  QUALITY (mis-route risk, dead/weak routes). Trigger hit-rate is the skill's core
  thesis but had no check. This surfaces structural routing smells at exactly the
  moments routing can change. Honest gap: edit-introduced smells only; silent
  time-drift (routes that stopped matching real work without an edit) needs Tier 2.
- Downstream refresh guidance: copy `scripts/route-health.sh` (update-upstream step 5
  picks up new mechanism files) and add the four advisory call-sites. It writes
  nothing and never blocks, so adoption is safe and incremental.

## 2026-06-03 - footprint.sh: static per-task read-cost dashboard (Tier 1)

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas:
  - `templates/skill/scripts/footprint.sh` (NEW) — static "speed dashboard":
    computes, in lines, the Always-Read floor, each route's per-task read cost
    (Always Read + required_reads + workflow), and the read-everything baseline,
    from `routing.yaml` + file sizes. Runs nothing, costs nothing per task. Diff the
    numbers before/after a change to catch the per-task floor creeping up.
- Why it matters: the skill measured structural health (line counts, links, orphans)
  but had no signal for whether it actually saves read cost per task. This makes the
  routing benefit visible (real chaos install: median task reads 429 lines vs 2243
  read-everything = 81% less; floor = 262) and gives a regression watch target.
  Honest scope: measures the routing/footprint dimension only — not skill-vs-no-skill
  (a with/without demo, Tier 3) nor discipline quality (pressure tests). Lines are a
  proxy — good for trend, not exact accounting.
- Downstream refresh guidance: copy `scripts/footprint.sh` (update-upstream step 5
  picks up new mechanism files). Run `bash skills/<name>/scripts/footprint.sh <name>`
  anytime; watch the Always-Read floor across changes. Not wired into CI/closure by
  design (zero per-task cost).

## 2026-06-03 - Upstream sync pointer + upstream-status.sh (multi-project sync)

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas:
  - `templates/skill/scripts/upstream-status.sh` (NEW) — downstream reader: reads
    `.upstream-sync` (recorded upstream sha), clones/fetches upstream, and lists the
    `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md` entries added since that sha. Exit 1 if behind, 0 if
    current, 2 if no pointer. Diagnosis only — porting stays update-upstream.md.
    Distinct from the upstream-side `check-upstream-changes.sh` guard.
  - `templates/skill/.upstream-sync` (NEW) — project-owned pointer: `upstream:` URL
    + `synced_sha:`. The version handle is the upstream git sha (no semver).
  - `templates/skill/workflows/update-upstream.md` — step 3 now runs
    `upstream-status.sh` to scope the refresh to "what's new since your sync point"
    (precise work-list instead of eyeballing the changelog); new step 11 writes
    `.upstream-sync` to the synced HEAD so the pointer stays current automatically;
    `.upstream-sync` classified as project-owned.
- Why it matters: "am I current with upstream / what do I need to pull?" was manual
  prose-reading + hand-diffing two repos — painful across multiple installs. Now it
  is one command that prints exactly the entries you are missing. The version handle
  is the upstream git sha, recorded at sync time, so it cannot go stale like a
  hand-bumped semver (which is why this is not a re-introduced version number).
- Downstream refresh guidance: copy `scripts/upstream-status.sh` (step 5 picks up new
  mechanism files automatically) and let update-upstream.md's final step create
  `.upstream-sync`. First run with no pointer just shows recent entries. Optional v2:
  add a framework-files `git diff` to the reporter.

## 2026-06-03 - Shell behavior block becomes a single-source generated block

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas:
  - `templates/skill/scripts/sync-routing.sh` — the shared shell behavior block
    (Auto-Triggers + Red Flags: re-read rule, closure trigger, skip-list, record
    rule, AAR red-flag) is now defined ONCE in the script and injected into every
    shell between `<!-- BEHAVIOR_BLOCK_START/END -->` markers, the same mechanism as
    ALWAYS_READ and ROUTING_BOOTSTRAP. Opt-in per shell: only shells that already
    contain the markers are synced, so older scaffolds without them do not fail.
  - `templates/shells/{CLAUDE,AGENTS,CODEX,GEMINI}.md` + `.cursor/rules/workflow.mdc`
    — hand-authored Auto-Triggers/Red-Flags replaced with the markers; content now
    generated and identical across shells. Normalized CODEX and the Cursor shell
    (they were missing the closure + red-flags bullets, and the Cursor shell pointed
    closure at `update-rules.md` instead of `task-closure.md`).
  - `templates/skill/routing.yaml`, `references/thin-shells.md` — doc note that the
    behavior block is generated (edit it in `sync-routing.sh`, not per shell).
- Why it matters: a one-line change to a behavioral rule (e.g. the tiered re-read)
  used to mean hand-editing ~6 shells + risking cross-harness drift (edit CLAUDE.md,
  forget GEMINI.md → different behavior per harness). Now it is one edit in
  `sync-routing.sh` + re-sync. Closes the project's own worst DRY violation.
- Downstream refresh guidance: refresh `scripts/sync-routing.sh`, then add
  `<!-- BEHAVIOR_BLOCK_START -->` / `<!-- BEHAVIOR_BLOCK_END -->` markers around your
  shells' Auto-Triggers/Red-Flags region and run sync. Until the markers exist, the
  script leaves your hand-authored block alone (no failure), so adoption is gradual.

## 2026-06-03 - Session Discipline: tiered re-read (downstream per-task speed)

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas:
  - `templates/skill/SKILL.md.template` § Session Discipline — replaced the
    unconditional "re-read this SKILL.md + re-read all route files every task"
    mandate with a tiered rule: **re-match the route every task** (cheap, catches a
    different-route task), but **re-read the route's files only when the route
    changed or context was compacted** (a fresh SKILL.md injection is the signal);
    background (principles / gotchas / boundaries) is read once per session.
    Fallback: unsure whether context compacted → re-read.
  - All thin-shell templates (`templates/shells/CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CODEX.md`,
    `GEMINI.md`, `.cursor/rules/workflow.mdc`) — same tiered rewrite of the "New
    task in same session" Auto-Trigger.
  - `templates/skill/workflows/fix-bug.md`, `change-managed.md` — pre-step changed
    from "re-read all required files" to "re-read the route's files only if the
    route changed or context compacted (see § Session Discipline)".
  - `references/self-hosting-shell-base.md` — same tiered rewrite; self-hosting root
    shells regenerated via `scripts/sync-self-shells.sh`.
  - `references/thin-shells.md`, `README.md`, `SKILL.md` Pitfall #8 — wording
    aligned to the tiered rule.
- Why it matters: the old rule made the agent re-read the full SKILL.md + every
  route file on *every* task in a session — the single biggest recurring per-task
  read tax for downstream users (hundreds of lines before any work, re-paid each
  task). The tiered rule keeps Pitfall #8's safety (re-match always catches a
  different route; compaction triggers a re-read; unsure → re-read) while removing
  the wasted re-reads of unchanged background and route files. Repeat same-route
  tasks drop from a full re-read to a cheap re-match.
- Downstream refresh guidance: adopt the new Session Discipline block and shell
  Auto-Trigger verbatim. Preserve the behavioral core: re-match every task; re-read
  on route-change or compaction; when in doubt, re-read. Do not revert to
  unconditional re-read — that is the tax this removes.

## 2026-06-03 - Baseline-first for discipline content (lightweight, conditional)

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas:
  - `references/scenario-testing.md` — added section "Baseline-First for Discipline
    Content": skills-as-TDD (RED = agent violates without the rule, GREEN =
    complies with it) for authoring red flags / rationalization rows / always-never
    constraints. Explicitly **not** a per-edit gate — scoped to discipline content
    and tiered so organic failures (ones you already watched) cost nothing; a
    subagent baseline runs only for an unobserved "just in case" rule, which is the
    imagined-pain fork. Includes the run steps and the prove-or-drop rule.
  - `templates/skill/workflows/update-rules.md` — added "Baseline Check (discipline
    rules only)" after the Recording Threshold: organic failure → record free;
    hunch with no observed failure → baseline-prove or drop. Routine recording
    where the failure already happened is exempt.
  - `SKILL.md` Principle #15 — the Rationalizations Table check now states a row's
    failure is either organic or proven by a baseline before shipping; no failure +
    unwilling to baseline = imagined-pain, drop. Edited in place.
- Why it matters: makes Common Pitfalls #10 (imagined-pain) executable without
  taxing iteration — most discipline rules reuse a failure you already saw (zero
  cost); the only paid case is precisely the speculative rule #10 already tells you
  to stop and justify. Deliberately rejects superpowers' universal "no skill
  without a failing test first" Iron Law as the wrong tier for a fast-iterating
  solo meta-skill.
- Downstream refresh guidance: port the `scenario-testing.md` section and the
  `update-rules.md` subsection; both are project-agnostic. Keep it conditional — do
  not promote it to a mandatory gate. Tune pressure types to your domain.

## 2026-06-03 - Description: forbid step-summaries (body-suppression trap)

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas:
  - `references/layout.md` § Description as Trigger Condition — added subsection
    "Trap: a step-summary in the description suppresses reading the body". A
    description that summarizes *how* a workflow runs (not just *which* workflows
    exist) becomes "enough to act on", so the agent executes the lossy summary and
    never opens the body. Distinct from keyword-stuffing: keyword-stuffing leaks
    *which workflows exist* (competes with routing); a step-summary leaks *how a
    workflow runs* (suppresses the body). Includes the superpowers eval evidence
    (one review vs two), a bad/good example, and a generalized check applying at
    every summary→detail link (description AND Common Tasks rows / `routing.yaml`
    labels), tied to Pitfall #8.
  - `SKILL.md` Principle #7 — restated to name both failure modes (enumerate
    keywords / summarize steps) and carry a two-part check. Edited in place, no
    line added (body budget unchanged).
  - `templates/skill/workflows/profile-project.md` Completion Checklist — the
    description check now also rejects a step-summary, so the trap is gated on the
    description-drafting path, not only stored in `references/`.
- Why it matters: a procedural description silently suppresses the whole skill
  body — the agent runs a degraded version and never reads the steps. Prior docs
  only guarded against vague / keyword-stuffed descriptions and missed this
  opposite (too-procedural) failure mode.
- Downstream refresh guidance: port the `layout.md` subsection and the
  `profile-project.md` checklist clause; both are project-agnostic. Preserve your
  own description trigger phrases — only the *principle* changed, not your
  project's triggers. If you regenerate `SKILL.md` from `routing.yaml`, re-run
  sync after adopting the #7 wording.

## 2026-06-01 - Subagent: make the Parallelism Premise non-blocking-by-mechanism

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas:
  - `templates/skill/workflows/subagent-driven.md` — the 2026-05-28 Parallelism
    Premise stated the *requirement* (main agent must keep working while a
    subagent runs) but gave no *mechanism*, so the decision flow read as a single
    **foreground** dispatch that blocks. Added the concrete non-blocking
    mechanism in three cases: (1) **batch parallel** — N independent chunks
    dispatched in one message run concurrently; (2) **background** —
    `run_in_background` + continue immediately when there is real main-thread
    work; (3) **neither** → inline (a lone foreground dispatch you wait on is
    worse than inline). Updated: top-of-file invariant ("non-blocking is the
    whole point, both modes"), the Parallelism Premise body + ✅/❌ examples, the
    Mode 1 decision-flow diagram, the Mode 1 Properties bullet, and Mode 2
    Phase 2 step 4 (name the "single message / `run_in_background`" mechanic).
  - `references/self-hosting-routing.yaml` — `long-run` route `workflow:` fixed
    from `templates/protocol-blocks/subagent-contract.md` (the Mode 2 fill-in
    contract) → `templates/skill/workflows/subagent-driven.md` (the Mode 1/Mode 2
    decision logic). A "big task" was being routed straight to the contract
    template, skipping the mode + non-blocking decision. Contract stays reachable
    as a sub-artifact subagent-driven.md links to.
- Why it matters: a foreground dispatch the main agent then waits on has the same
  wall-clock as inline plus coordination overhead — strictly worse than not
  dispatching. The premise existed to prevent exactly this but, lacking a
  mechanism, agents would still block. Naming the two concurrency primitives
  (batch-in-one-message, `run_in_background`) makes "main agent keeps moving" an
  executable instruction rather than an aspiration. Builds on (does not reverse)
  the 2026-05-28 Parallelism Premise entry.
- Downstream refresh guidance:
  - `subagent-driven.md` is a template workflow you copy. Port the non-blocking
    mechanism (the three-case Parallelism Premise, the decision-flow branches,
    the Properties bullet, Mode 2 Phase 2 step 4) into your local copy, preserving
    your project-specific FILL blocks (Phase 3 verification commands, Forbidden
    Zone defaults) and any local Mode 1 signal rows.
  - Map the harness primitives to yours: "batch in one message" + `run_in_background`
    are Claude Code's. Codex `spawn_agent` users adapt to their concurrency model;
    on harnesses with no background/parallel dispatch, the honest fallback is
    inline (Case 3), not a blocking foreground dispatch.
  - If your routing manifest sends a "large/multi-subtask" route at the contract
    block, repoint it at `workflows/subagent-driven.md` so the mode + non-blocking
    decision happens first.

## 2026-05-29 - Extract Task Closure Protocol into its own canonical workflow

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas:
  - **NEW `templates/skill/workflows/task-closure.md`** — the cross-cutting
    closure gate now has its own correctly-named home: Task Closure Trigger
    Policy, the six closure steps, the 30-second AAR scan, Rationalizations to
    Reject, Red Flags. Its "record if needed" step (3) points into
    `update-rules.md` for the recording mechanics.
  - `templates/skill/workflows/update-rules.md` — closure gate + AAR +
    Rationalizations + Red Flags removed (moved to `task-closure.md`). Kept:
    Classification Guide, Sync Targets, and the **recording mechanics**
    (Recording Threshold, Search Before Record, Where To Record, Activation
    Check, Generalization Rule, Entry Tagging, Structural Placement), plus Rule
    Deprecation and Post-Update Health Check. New `## Task Closure` pointer
    section + `## Recording Lessons` H2 parent for the recording H3s.
  - `templates/skill/conformance.yaml` — split the `update-rules.md`
    must_contain block: closure-gate assertions (`## Task Closure Protocol`,
    `### Rationalizations to Reject`, `### Red Flags`, `## After-Action Review`)
    moved to a new `workflows/task-closure.md` entry; recording assertions
    (`### Recording Threshold`, `### Activation Check`, `### Generalization
    Rule`) stay on `update-rules.md`. Added `task-closure.md` to required_files.
  - Repointed closure-step refs (`fix-bug`, `change-managed`, `edit-templates`,
    `refactor-fanout`, `skill-composition.md`, `thin-shells.md`), Rationalizations
    refs (`SKILL.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`, `full-migration.md`, `behavior-failures.md`,
    `TEMPLATES-GUIDE.md`, `protocols.md`), and all shells (3 template shells +
    4 generated root shells via `self-hosting-shell-base.md`) from
    `update-rules.md` → `task-closure.md`.
- Why it matters: the closure gate is cross-cutting (every behavior-changing
  task runs it) but its canonical text lived inside a file named for rule
  updates, so every other workflow said "run Task Closure Protocol from the
  rule-update workflow" — an ownership inversion held together only by
  hand-written cross-refs. `rationalizations-table.md` / `red-flags-stop.md`
  were already extracted to `protocol-blocks/`; this completes that half-done
  extraction. The gate now decides *whether* to record; `update-rules.md`
  decides *how*.
- Downstream refresh guidance:
  - **STOP — do not apply the default "copy new mechanism files whole" step for
    this change if your `update-rules.md` is localized or structurally diverged**
    (translated to another language, or you keep Blast-Radius Buckets / extra
    sections inside it). Dropping upstream's English `task-closure.md` in as-is
    leaves the closure gate **duplicated in two files** — your localized
    `update-rules.md` still holds it, now alongside an English `task-closure.md`.
    Instead, **extract your own closure sections** (Task Closure Protocol, Trigger
    Policy, Rationalizations to Reject, Red Flags, After-Action Review) out of your
    local `update-rules.md` into a new `task-closure.md`, preserving your language
    and local placement, then **delete those sections from `update-rules.md`**.
  - This is an **additive** change at the *upstream* level (chosen over renaming
    `update-rules.md`, which would risk losing downstream-local content on every
    refresh) — but inside *your* repo it is still a content move, not a file copy.
    Keep your project-specific recording targets and any locally-added
    Rationalizations rows.
  - Repoint every `workflows/update-rules.md` reference that means "run the
    closure gate" or "§ Rationalizations to Reject" → `workflows/task-closure.md`.
    Refs that mean "recording threshold / activation / generalization" stay on
    `update-rules.md`.
  - Update your `conformance.yaml` exactly as above (move the closure-gate
    assertions to a `workflows/task-closure.md` entry; keep the recording ones on
    `update-rules.md`; add `task-closure.md` to required_files), then validate
    against the freshly-cloned **upstream** manifest:
    `bash skills/<name>/scripts/check-version-conformance.sh skills/<name> --conformance <upstream-clone>/templates/skill/conformance.yaml`.
  - **conformance is presence-only — it verifies `task-closure.md` *has* the gate
    headings, never that `update-rules.md` no longer does.** A half-finished
    migration (new file created, old sections left in place) passes green. After
    migrating, **manually `grep` your `update-rules.md`** to confirm
    `## Task Closure Protocol`, `### Rationalizations to Reject`, `### Red Flags`,
    and `## After-Action Review` are **gone**. No check catches a leftover copy;
    it will silently drift from the canonical `task-closure.md`.

## 2026-05-29 - Self-hosting routing: kill spin-routes, merge overlap, demote long-run to modifier

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas:
  - `references/self-hosting-routing.yaml` — three routing-clarity fixes:
    1. Merged `revise-skill-principle` + `revise-reference` into one route
       `revise-skill-doc`. Both were the same underlying task (edit a skill
       doc, then close) and overlapped with no disambiguator. Added a `note:`
       pointing routing/description hit-rate work to `improve-activation-routing`.
    2. Both old routes' `workflow:` pointed back at a doc section already in
       their `required_reads` (`SKILL.md#core-principles`, `references/README.md`)
       — a route that does no routing. The merged route's `workflow:` now points
       to the real procedure `templates/skill/workflows/update-rules.md`.
    3. `long-run` reframed from a standalone task to a cross-cutting modifier
       via label + `note:` ("apply ON TOP of the matched primary route"). It
       routes by task *size*, not intent, so it competed with every real route
       (a big migration matched both `migrate-downstream` and `long-run`).
- Why it matters: self-hosting shells do NOT render the task list (the routing
  block in `scripts/sync-self-shells.sh` is hardcoded; the yaml is read at
  runtime and only path-validated at sync). So these edits change agent routing
  behavior without any shell drift. Removes two false route choices and one
  size/intent category confusion — the structural-complexity tax the simpler
  single-flow skills avoid by construction.
- Downstream refresh guidance:
  - This is a self-hosting-only manifest; downstream projects own their own
    `routing.yaml`. No file to port. The transferable lesson: a `workflow:`
    that points back into its own `required_reads` is a spin-route — point it
    at a real procedure or delete it. And task-size belongs as a modifier
    layered on the matched route, never as a sibling task entry.

## 2026-05-28 - Subagent Mode 1: Parallelism Premise + stale anchor cleanup

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas:
  - `templates/skill/workflows/subagent-driven.md` — new
    `### Parallelism Premise (precondition for the Iron Law)` subsection
    inserted between the Iron Law block and `### Default habit`. Adds a
    third question before every `spawn_agent`: "what is the main agent
    doing **while** the subagent runs?" Without parallel work the
    dispatch is indirection theater — same wall-clock as inline plus
    coordination overhead, zero efficiency gain. Includes a
    context-isolation exception for cases where inline reads would
    drown the main context with raw file content.
  - `templates/skill/workflows/{plan-feature,change-managed,fix-bug}.md` —
    three stale `#mode-1-surface-sub-step-auxiliary-delegation` anchor
    fragments repaired to `#mode-1-direct-auxiliary-delegation`, with
    the display text "§ Mode 1: Surface" updated to
    "§ Mode 1: Direct Auxiliary Delegation". Followup to upstream
    `c0bc072` (2026-05-20) which renamed the Mode 1 heading but left
    these cross-refs stale.
- Why it matters: the existing Iron Law's "mechanical + time-consuming +
  only-need-result" trigger implicitly assumed the main agent has parallel
  work, but never said so. Agents would `spawn_agent`, then idle waiting
  for the result, paying coordination cost with no wall-clock gain.
  Parallelism Premise makes the precondition explicit and surfaces the
  honest context-budgeting exception. The anchor cleanup is path-integrity
  debt from `c0bc072`; discovered via the cut/stop (C) audit, not via a
  user trip — but it would silently misroute any agent following the link.
- Downstream refresh guidance:
  - Port the `Parallelism Premise` subsection verbatim into your local
    `subagent-driven.md` between Iron Law and `Default habit`. The
    principle is project-agnostic; only adjust path references inside
    the examples if your skill renames Mode 1's framing.
  - Search local workflows for any `#mode-1-surface-sub-step-auxiliary-delegation`
    references and replace with `#mode-1-direct-auxiliary-delegation`.
    If you haven't pulled the `c0bc072` rename yet, port both in the
    same pass.

## 2026-05-25 - Blast-radius bucket closure triggers

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas:
  - `references/protocols.md` — added § "Blast-Radius Buckets (closure
    trigger refinement)" subsection under Task Closure Protocol.
    Introduces per-path A/B/C classification (A = full closure incl.
    smoke + path-integrity gates, B = lightweight AAR only,
    C = skip closure entirely), the multi-file max-bucket rule, the
    unknown-path default-B rule, and the "trivial edit in A still =
    full closure" mechanical rule. Bucket path lists are this repo's
    specific layout.
  - `references/self-hosting-shell-base.md` — replaced the 3-bullet
    task-type closure trigger with a 6-bullet blast-radius bullet
    block that names A/B/C buckets, key combination rules, the
    Q&A/read-only exemption, and a pointer to protocols.md for full
    path lists. All 4 root shells (AGENTS / CLAUDE / CODEX / GEMINI)
    + `.cursor/rules/workflow.mdc` regenerated via
    `sync-self-shells.sh`.
- Why it matters: the prior trigger model (Pure Q&A / Code change /
  Skill docs) was too coarse — every non-Q&A edit ran lightweight
  AAR even on README / examples / unlinked references, paying
  recurring "load template + reason through 4 questions" overhead
  with near-zero hit rate. Blast-radius keys the trigger off the
  file path itself, so low-risk content edits (Bucket C) skip
  closure outright; only entry shells, routing yaml, scripts, and
  template `.tpl` files (A) still get the full gate.
- Downstream refresh guidance:
  - The blast-radius methodology is project-agnostic; the **A/B/C
    path lists are per-repo**. Downstream projects adopting this
    refinement should mirror the subsection structure in their own
    `skills/<name>/references/protocols.md` and fill in their own
    file classifications.
  - The shell-base bullets reference blast-radius with parenthetical
    examples ("entry shells / SKILL.md / routing yaml / scripts /
    `*.tpl`"). Adjust the parentheticals when porting if the
    downstream's high-risk surface differs.
  - **No template file changed.** This is currently a
    self-hosting-only refinement. Promote to
    `templates/skill/workflows/update-rules.md` only after a second
    project pressure-tests the bucket model — applying SKILL.md
    Rule 10 (no template additions without two-project pressure).

## 2026-05-21 - Mode 1 → Direct Auxiliary Delegation + Inspect→Dispatch Pitfall + Interception Transparency

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas: rewrote `templates/skill/workflows/subagent-driven.md`
  (Mode 1 章节 renamed "Direct Auxiliary Delegation", removed
  degraded-harness information-display isolation entire section,
  simplified Decision flow to no Y/N user round-trip, added Iron Law
  declaration, added Negative list + reverse-failure Pitfall, added
  Inspect→Dispatch transition Pitfall with named anchor, added new
  top-level "Interception Transparency Rule" section, updated
  Rationalizations + Red Flags); added top-level pervasive
  reverse-question cross-refs to `fix-bug.md`, `plan-feature.md`,
  `change-managed.md`, `refactor-fanout.md`.
- Why it matters: the chaos project's subagent-driven Mode 1 went
  through 6+ iteration rounds on real chaos task screenshots (5/19 →
  5/21). Key empirical findings now propagated to upstream:
    1. **Global authorization removes the Y/N round-trip** — once
       `~/.codex/config.toml` has `developer_instructions = "Subagents
       may be used proactively..."`, Codex no longer guards
       `spawn_agent`. Earlier "被拦截才问" / "Surface Y/N then spawn"
       designs were Codex workaround content; obsolete with global
       config.
    2. **Inspect → Dispatch transition** is the most severe real
       failure mode observed — main agent finishes pre-work (reading
       rules / report / identifying multiple targets) and continues
       inline by inertia into implementation, missing the explicit
       phase switch. Anchor name lets agent self-check and user
       interrupt use the same vocabulary.
    3. **Interception transparency is a universal rule**, not just
       a `spawn_agent` workaround — any tool / permission / constraint
       block should surface to the user, not silently fall back to
       plan B. This is a separate concern from Mode 1's decision-time
       self-judgment.
    4. **LLM bias is real and structural** — even with Iron Law +
       named Pitfalls + explicit two-step separation, the agent will
       sometimes skip the reverse-question and inline. Soft rules
       improve the trigger rate but don't root-cause it. User
       monitoring remains the necessary backstop. Documented in the
       Pitfalls section.
- Downstream refresh guidance: for each downstream `subagent-driven.md`:
    1. Replace Mode 1 章节 header / content with the new "Direct
       Auxiliary Delegation" version
    2. Remove the "Mode 1 on degraded harness: information-display
       isolation" section entirely (obsolete with global Codex auth)
    3. Add the new "Interception Transparency Rule" section
    4. Update Decision flow to remove Y/N round-trip
    5. Update Rationalizations + Red Flags per upstream
  For each of `fix-bug.md` / `plan-feature.md` / `change-managed.md` /
  `refactor-fanout.md`: add top-level pervasive reverse-question
  cross-ref. Project-specific workflows (e.g. chaos's
  `implement-feature.md`, chaos_web's `add-page-or-module.md` etc.)
  should mirror the same top-level cross-ref. Downstream should also
  consider adding the Inspect → Dispatch Pitfall + Negative list +
  Interception transparency content somewhere always-read (e.g.
  `rules/project-rules.md`) — chaos puts it there, you can too.
  No routing.yaml or conformance.yaml changes required.

## 2026-05-20 - Surface mode in subagent-driven (Mode 1) — sub-step auxiliary delegation

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas: restructured `templates/skill/workflows/subagent-driven.md`
  into two modes — new `## Mode 1: Surface (Sub-step Auxiliary Delegation)`
  (signal admission test + 5-signal reverse-question list + decision flow
  + job-vs-auxiliary distinction + display-isolation fallback for Codex
  and other degraded harnesses); renamed original `## When to Use` to
  `## Mode 2: Four Phases (When to Invoke This Mode)`; shared sections
  (Harness Compatibility / Rationalizations / Red Flags / Degraded Mode)
  retained and re-labelled. Updated cross-refs in
  `templates/skill/workflows/fix-bug.md` Step 6 (test/build → Surface
  signals #1/#2), `templates/skill/workflows/plan-feature.md` Step 3
  (wide grep → Surface signal #3) and Step 7 (multi-hour
  multi-subtask → Mode 2 Four Phases), and
  `templates/skill/workflows/change-managed.md` Step 3 (≥ 5-file
  batch homogeneous edits → Surface signal #4 or `refactor-fanout.md`
  if planned from start). Companion plan at
  `docs/plans/2026-05-20-subagent-surface-hints.md`.
- Why it matters: three earlier chaos screenshots showed main-agent
  doing test debugging / wide explore / batch edits inline when the
  work was clearly auxiliary (mechanical + time-consuming +
  only-need-result). Previous tuning attempts (fix-bug Hypothesis
  Fan-out, plan-feature Step 3/7 subagent hints, refactor-fanout
  workflow) didn't catch these moments because they framed dispatch
  as "task-size triggered" — and the agent's task-size judgment is
  systematically biased toward inline ("I'll just do one more file").
  Reverse-question framing ("是不是多余") inverts the bias: the agent
  must defend "not redundant" instead of "should dispatch", and
  defending "not redundant" on mechanical sub-steps is hard. The
  admission test (reverse-question passes + scenario specific)
  filters out task-size signals that previously slipped through.
  Mode 1 is default — main-agent inline stays as fallback; Mode 2
  Four Phases is the existing pattern for planned multi-subtask work.
  Codex / Cursor / Gemini get display-isolation fallback (Yes = paste
  conclusion only; No = paste full output), which gives visible
  benefit on degraded harnesses even though context isolation is
  impossible there.
- Downstream refresh guidance: this is an **incremental insertion**,
  not a file replacement. For each downstream `subagent-driven.md`:
  (1) insert the new `## Mode 1: Surface` block before the existing
  `## When to Use`; (2) rename `## When to Use` → `## Mode 2: Four
  Phases (When to Invoke This Mode)`; (3) add a "two modes" overview
  at the file top; (4) leave all other sections (Phase 1-4
  descriptions / Rationalizations / Red Flags / Degraded Mode /
  project-specific examples) untouched, including project-local
  edits. If the downstream `subagent-driven.md` has already added
  its own sub-step delegation mechanism, diff against the new Mode 1
  and take the union — do not overwrite. Then patch the 3 workflow
  cross-refs in `fix-bug.md` / `plan-feature.md` /
  `change-managed.md` to point at Mode 1: Surface; mirror the same
  cross-ref pattern in project-specific workflows that share the
  inspect-then-edit / explore-then-action shape (chaos's
  `implement-feature.md`, chaos_web's
  `add-page-or-module.md` / `add-amis-page.md` /
  `add-hybrid-renderer.md` / `fix-schema-error.md`). No routing.yaml
  changes required; no conformance.yaml changes required (Mode 1 is
  a tuning, not a contract).

## 2026-05-19 - Surface subagent fan-out at the 3 highest-ROI downstream moments

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas: `templates/skill/workflows/fix-bug.md` (added § Hypothesis
  Fan-out section + cross-ref from Step 3); `templates/skill/workflows/plan-feature.md`
  (Step 3 + Step 7 now point at `subagent-driven.md` when scope justifies it);
  `templates/skill/workflows/refactor-fanout.md` (new file — 3-phase
  find-usage / fan-out / merge workflow for ≥5-site refactors);
  `templates/skill/routing.yaml` (new `refactor-fanout` task route + cross-ref
  from `change-managed` row); regenerated `templates/skill/SKILL.md.template`
  + thin shells via `sync-routing.sh`.
- Why it matters: downstream users' three highest-frequency tasks — fixing
  bugs, planning features, doing N-point refactors — each have a clear
  parallelism opportunity that the existing workflows did not surface:
    1. **Bugs with 2+ live hypotheses** — serial elimination pollutes the
       main context with rabbit holes. Fan-out gives each hypothesis its
       own subagent and brings back only verdicts. Optional, triggers only
       when ≥ 2 hypotheses + > 30% context budget at risk.
    2. **Plans whose inspection reads > 20 files** — Step 3 (Inspect first)
       was implicitly inline; now it explicitly suggests an `explore`
       subagent and returning a structured summary instead. Optional.
       Step 7 (Prepare execution context) now also flags that the
       implementer is often itself a subagent, so the reading list is
       planned as `Inputs` contracts rather than ad-hoc.
    3. **N-point refactors (rename / signature change / interface
       extract)** — new dedicated workflow because cut-points + parallel
       batches + cross-batch consistency check are different mechanics from
       generic `change-managed.md`. Routes only fire on ≥5-site refactors;
       smaller refactors still use `change-managed.md`.
  All three additions explicitly carry a "skip on degraded harness or when
  scope is small" clause — the dispatch overhead must be paid back by real
  context savings, otherwise it is reverse ROI. None of the three is added
  to `conformance.yaml` as a required section: they are optimization
  patterns, not safety mechanisms.
- Downstream refresh guidance: pull the three workflow files
  (`fix-bug.md` § Hypothesis Fan-out paragraph, `plan-feature.md` Step 3 +
  Step 7 updates, `refactor-fanout.md` whole-file copy) and add the
  `refactor-fanout` row to your local `routing.yaml` (in the order
  upstream put it — after `change-managed`). Then run
  `bash skills/<name>/scripts/sync-routing.sh <name>` to regenerate
  SKILL.md and shells. If your project has never had a 5+-site refactor,
  you can skip `refactor-fanout.md` and the routing row entirely — re-pull
  when the situation actually appears. The fan-out / explore-subagent
  recommendations are written as optional clauses, so downstream agents
  on Cursor / Codex / Gemini (no native dispatch) can ignore them
  without breaking the workflow shape.

## 2026-05-19 - Strip complex-plan canonical schema; only `prd.md` required

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas: `templates/skill/workflows/plan-feature.md` (rewrote § Complex
  Plan, § Complex Steps, workflow-state blocks, completion checklist),
  `docs/plans/README.md` (rewrote complex-plan section), `templates/skill/conformance.yaml`
  (removed `## Complex Task Dossier` / `decisions.md` / `implement.jsonl` /
  `check.jsonl` from `must_contain`; added `## Complex Plan` + `prd.md` instead),
  `references/thin-shells.md`, `TEMPLATES-GUIDE.md`,
  `templates/skill/workflows/update-rules.md` (Plan-closure prompt phrasing).
- Why it matters: the previous complex-plan ("dossier") schema mandated a
  7-file structure — `prd.md`, `decisions.md`, `checklist.md`, `research/`,
  `evidence/`, `implement.jsonl`, `check.jsonl` — for any plan that hit the
  Complexity Gate. Audit found:
    1. **0 plans ever used the dossier shape.** The one real plan in
       `docs/plans/` (`2026-05-12-thin-shells-generator.md`) satisfied
       multiple Complex triggers (architecture choice, external dependency,
       multiple files) yet the author wrote it as a simple single file.
       The protocol was rejected in its first contact with reality.
    2. **No consumer for the JSONL files.** `implement.jsonl` and
       `check.jsonl` chose JSONL over markdown, implying script consumption.
       `grep -rln '\.jsonl' scripts/ templates/skill/scripts/` → 0 hits.
       Same shape as the recently-removed `<!-- external-fact -->` marker:
       protocol defined, no consumer, runs empty forever.
    3. **Schema without template.** The simple plan had `_TEMPLATE.md`;
       the dossier had only prose description in README + workflow. Authors
       would have to hand-assemble 7 files from text instructions —
       "stored, not activated" (SKILL.md Pitfall #4).
    4. **100% cognitive tax on simple-plan authors.** Every reader of
       `docs/plans/README.md` (~20% dossier content) and `plan-feature.md`
       had to scan past the dossier rules to confirm "I don't need this".
    5. **Conformance manifest locked the shape into a contract.** Downstream
       skills running `check-version-conformance.sh` were required to
       reproduce `## Complex Task Dossier` + JSONL filenames — propagating
       the imagined-pain protocol as a hard contract.
  The form (a directory with multiple files) is not the problem — a real
  complex plan naturally wants more than one file. The problem was
  pre-defining **which** files, with **canonical names**, under a **forced
  trigger**, before any real complex plan existed to validate the schema.
  Now: complex plan = directory + `prd.md` (only required file). Everything
  else is the author's call; conventions earn the right to exist by
  appearing in two or more real plans first.
- Downstream refresh guidance: in your downstream copy of
  `workflows/plan-feature.md`, replace § Complex Task Dossier (or whatever
  your local equivalent is called) with the new minimum: directory +
  `prd.md` required, no canonical names for siblings. Remove any local
  copy of the JSONL row shape. Update completion checklist to drop hard
  references to `decisions.md` / `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl` / `research/`
  / `evidence/`. If your local `docs/plans/README.md` mirrors the upstream
  shape, apply the same trim. If a project's actual past plans found a
  sibling convention useful (e.g. a `decisions.md` log), that's fine —
  but keep it as observed convention, not enforced contract; don't add it
  to a local conformance manifest.

## 2026-05-19 - Remove 5 imagined-pain template scripts; merge into `audit-orphans.sh`

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas: deleted `templates/skill/scripts/check-external-facts.sh`,
  `templates/skill/scripts/test-trigger.sh`,
  `templates/skill/scripts/check-description-routing.sh`,
  `templates/skill/scripts/audit-references.sh`,
  `templates/skill/scripts/audit-route-paths.sh`;
  added `templates/skill/scripts/audit-orphans.sh` (84 lines, replaces
  audit-references + audit-route-paths' high-value 80%);
  updated `scripts/check-all.sh`, `scripts/check-self-scenarios.sh`,
  `scripts/README.md`, `templates/skill/scripts/smoke-test.sh § 4h`,
  `templates/skill/scripts/check-growth-health.sh` (script-size case
  branches), `templates/skill/workflows/update-rules.md`,
  `templates/skill/workflows/maintain-docs.md` (removed § 1c),
  `templates/skill/workflows/update-upstream.md`,
  `templates/README.md` (file listing + budget rows + Anti-Drift step 6),
  `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`,
  `references/self-hosting-routing.yaml`, `references/protocols.md`,
  `references/layout.md`, `references/multi-skill-routing.md`,
  `workflows/upgrade-downstream.md`, `examples/behavior-failures.md`,
  `docs/linuxdo-project-introduction.md`.
- Why it matters: a structural audit found these 5 scripts (~1166 lines)
  enforced disciplines no project would actually follow:
    - `check-external-facts.sh` required authors to hand-mark every
      vendor/tool/runtime fact with `<!-- external-fact: verified=... -->`
      comments. No project ever did; the script ran empty.
    - `test-trigger.sh` (554 lines) used `claude -p` to measure description
      activation rate. Almost no downstream cron-ran it.
    - `check-description-routing.sh` (125 lines of YAML parsing) flagged
      things a human eyeballs in 30 seconds re-reading description.
    - `audit-references.sh` (214) and `audit-route-paths.sh` (191) both
      validated "is this file linked?" at slightly different strictness;
      one combined script covers the high-value orphan check.
  The pattern: each script solved an *imagined* pain. The cost was real —
  every downstream skill carried ~1.2k lines of bash + workflow text
  pointing at protocols nobody enforced. **Stored, not activated** (SKILL.md
  Pitfall #4) applies to scripts as much as to references. Net delete:
  ~1082 lines after counting the 84-line replacement.
- Downstream refresh guidance: delete the same 5 files from
  `skills/<name>/scripts/`. Copy `audit-orphans.sh` from upstream. Run
  `(cd skills/<name> && bash scripts/audit-orphans.sh)` once after the
  refresh — if any orphan surfaces, decide per file whether to add an
  activation pointer or delete the file. Remove references to the deleted
  scripts from local copies of `workflows/update-rules.md`,
  `workflows/maintain-docs.md`, `workflows/update-upstream.md`. If your
  downstream wired any of the 5 into a CI step or a custom check-all
  orchestrator, drop those lines. The discipline they enforced moves to
  human re-read; the protocol-blocks rationalizations table stays.

## 2026-05-12 - Self-hosting thin-shell generator (`sync-self-shells.sh`)

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas: `references/self-hosting-shell-base.md` (new — common body),
  `references/self-hosting-shells.yaml` (new — per-harness deltas),
  `scripts/sync-self-shells.sh` (renamed from `sync-self-routing.sh`,
  rewritten for whole-shell generation),
  `scripts/check-self-shells.sh` (renamed from `check-self-routing.sh`,
  internal call updated),
  `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`, `GEMINI.md`,
  `.cursor/rules/workflow.mdc` (now generated, do NOT hand-edit),
  `scripts/check-all.sh` (label + script-name update),
  `scripts/README.md`, `REFERENCE.md`, `references/self-hosting-routing.yaml`
  (header comment), `templates/skill/scripts/smoke-test.sh § 7`,
  `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md`
- Why it matters: the previous `sync-self-routing.sh` only managed the routing
  block between `<!-- SELF_ROUTING_BLOCK_START -->` markers (~12 lines per
  shell). The other ~18 lines per shell — opening, Auto-Triggers, Red Flags,
  per-harness notes — were hand-maintained. Direct diff of the four shells
  pre-generator showed **5 unintended drifts already present**:
    1. `AGENTS.md` had a unique 2-paragraph opening; the other three diverged
       on whether to link `[references/layout.md]`.
    2. CODEX/GEMINI lost the `"I already read it" is not valid — context
       compresses, routes differ` clause that AGENTS/CLAUDE carry.
    3. CODEX/GEMINI lost the `See § Rationalizations to Reject` reference
       in the first Red Flag bullet.
    4. CODEX had a short version of the ANTI-TEMPLATES Red Flag without the
       file reference.
    5. `.cursor/rules/workflow.mdc` Red Flag still said `SKILL.md stays ≤ 100
       lines` — outdated since 2026-05-09's dual-budget change (description
       ≤ 25 + body ≤ 90). Hand-maintained docs drift in proportion to file
       count × edit cadence.
  Pointer-style solutions ("CLAUDE.md says 'go read E'") fail by the same
  mechanism as the Soft-pointer-only shell pitfall (SKILL.md § Common
  Pitfalls #2): harness context-compaction can drop the pointer between
  session start and the moment the agent needs the protocol. Symlinks fail
  on Windows + force 100% identity, killing legitimate per-harness deltas
  (e.g. CODEX's `apply_patch` notes). Therefore: build-time generation,
  read-time literal content.

  Source-of-truth files:
    - `references/self-hosting-shell-base.md` — common body (Auto-Triggers +
      Red Flags). Single place to update the wording every shell shares.
    - `references/self-hosting-shells.yaml` — per-harness `file`, `title`,
      optional `frontmatter` (only `.mdc` uses), `opening`, optional
      `appended` (only CODEX uses for `## Codex-specific notes`).

  Generation:
    - `scripts/sync-self-shells.sh` composes each entry from base + yaml +
      hardcoded routing block, writes to disk. Targets: 4 root shells +
      `.cursor/rules/workflow.mdc` in full-file mode; `.cursor/skills/.../
      SKILL.md` in routing-block-only mode (the rest is Cursor-registration
      specific and stays hand-maintained; description identity is checked
      separately by `check-self-shells.sh`).
    - `--check` mode diffs generated content against on-disk and exits
      non-zero on drift — wired into `check-all.sh` ("self-hosting shells +
      activation check").

  Drift outcome after generation (verified by `diff` of resulting files):
    - CLAUDE ↔ GEMINI: differ by only the `# CLAUDE.md` / `# GEMINI.md` title.
    - CLAUDE ↔ CODEX: title + the legitimate `## Codex-specific notes`
      appended section.
    - AGENTS ↔ CLAUDE: title + AGENTS's unique 2-paragraph opening
      (intentionally preserved as per-harness delta — AGENTS is the most
      generic shell, read by tools that don't have a specific narrowing).
    - All five files: `--check` returns OK.

  No new external dependencies (custom yaml subset parser inline; pattern
  matches `_parse_conformance.py`). One Python composition bug (extra blank
  line from a stray `\n` in a join part) was caught by visual inspection of
  `head -8 CLAUDE.md` and fixed before this commit.
- Downstream refresh guidance: this generator is **upstream-only**
  maintenance. Do NOT copy `sync-self-shells.sh`, `self-hosting-shell-base.md`,
  `self-hosting-shells.yaml`, or `check-self-shells.sh` into downstream
  projects. Downstream shells follow `templates/shells/` (a separate seed
  set that each project owns after scaffold). If a downstream project finds
  its own four shells drifting and wants the same generator pattern, port
  the structure but keep the source files local — they are project knowledge,
  not template content.

## 2026-05-12 - `Status: superseded by` field + check for reversed UPSTREAM-CHANGES entries

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas: `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md` (schema doc),
  `templates/skill/workflows/update-upstream.md` (step 3 read semantic),
  `scripts/check-upstream-supersedes.sh` (new),
  `scripts/check-all.sh` (wire new check), `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md` (this entry)
- Why it matters: until now, UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md was a strictly append-only
  time log. The archive policy moves old entries out of context, but it does
  not address the second-order problem: **later commits can reverse the
  guidance of earlier entries, and the older entry has no signal that it has
  been overruled**. A downstream refresh agent reading an archived entry from
  3 months ago will follow its instructions verbatim — even if upstream
  removed the file it tells them to add. Probability across many downstream
  skills and a multi-quarter horizon approaches 1.

  Mechanism: entries gain an optional `Status:` line as their first bullet.
  Two values:
    - `Status: superseded by YYYY-MM-DD - <title>` — newer entry replaces this
      guidance; refresh agents follow the newer one, skip this one.
    - `Status: deprecated — <one-line reason>` — mechanism removed entirely;
      no replacement.
  Pointers are **one-way** (older entry → newer entry). The newer entry can
  mention the supersede in prose but does not carry machine markup —
  bidirectional references would double the bookkeeping cost without
  improving check coverage.

  Enforcement: `scripts/check-upstream-supersedes.sh` validates every
  `Status: superseded by` reference resolves to a real `## YYYY-MM-DD -
  title` H2 heading in `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md` or
  `UPSTREAM-CHANGES-archive.md`. Fence-aware (schema examples inside
  ```` ```text ```` blocks are skipped, not treated as references).
  Wired into `check-all.sh` between the change-note guard and the routing
  manifest check.

  Read protocol: `templates/skill/workflows/update-upstream.md § Procedure
  step 3` now instructs downstream refresh agents to skip any entry whose
  first bullet starts with `- Status: superseded by …` or `- Status:
  deprecated …`.
- Downstream refresh guidance: pull the updated
  `workflows/update-upstream.md` as a mechanism-owned file. The
  `check-upstream-supersedes.sh` script is upstream-only maintenance —
  do NOT copy it into downstream projects. Downstream UPSTREAM-CHANGES
  consumption changes are read-only: when a refresh entry's first bullet
  is `Status: superseded by …`, follow the entry it points to instead.
  When `Status: deprecated`, skip entirely.

## 2026-05-12 - Tier-2 maintenance ledger (`.maintenance-log.yaml`)

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas: `templates/skill/workflows/maintain-docs.md`,
  `templates/skill/scripts/smoke-test.sh`, `templates/README.md`,
  `.maintenance-log.yaml` (new — upstream self-hosting bootstrap),
  `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md`
- Why it matters: closes a dangling clock in the Tier 0/1/2 model shipped
  on 2026-05-11. The Tier-2 trigger list included "Smoke-test Tier-0
  flagged a duplicate **and** the previous Tier-2 pass was more than ~30
  days ago" but nothing in the architecture recorded when a Tier-2 pass
  actually ran. Three observable failure modes:
    1. **Never triggers** — agent reads the condition, finds no record,
       treats "no record" as "no event", skips Tier-2. The drift the tier
       was designed to catch accumulates silently (real example: chaos_web
       audit found 4 verbatim-dup entries before any agent noticed).
    2. **Always triggers** — different agent reads the same condition,
       treats "no record ≡ infinitely old", runs full reorg every time
       smoke-test reports a dup. Token cost balloons.
    3. **Inconsistent across sessions** — the two agents above are the
       same agent on different days. Tier-2 fires unpredictably and no
       decision is reproducible.
  Fix: introduce `.maintenance-log.yaml` at the skill root as the per-file
  Tier-2 timestamp. Schema is lenient (`path` required, `last_tier2`
  required once a pass has run, rest advisory) so the file stays
  hand-editable. `maintain-docs.md § Step 7` now adds the write step as a
  Tier-2 closure gate — Tier-2 is incomplete until the ledger is updated.
  `smoke-test.sh § 2a` reads the ledger on every detected dup `##` heading
  and prints one of three Tier-2 hints (no entry / > 30d / ≤ 30d). The
  duplicate itself still always fails; the ledger only governs the *reorg
  recommendation* on top.

  Side effect: `smoke-test.sh` budget raised from 800 to 850 lines in
  `templates/README.md`. The ~25 lines of helpers + advisory branch are
  the minimum that closes the dangling clock. **Next addition to
  `smoke-test.sh` forces extraction** into a `check-<concern>.sh`
  companion (same pattern as `check-description-routing.sh`); the next
  budget bump is not on the table.
- Downstream refresh guidance: pull the updated `workflows/maintain-docs.md`
  and `scripts/smoke-test.sh` as mechanism-owned files. Then, for each
  long-lived entries-style file in your skill (`references/gotchas.md`,
  any `*pitfall*.md`, plus optionally entry-style logs like a project's
  decision log or upstream-changes log), add an entry to a new
  `skills/<name>/.maintenance-log.yaml` per the schema in `Step 7`. If
  no Tier-2 has been run on that file yet, omit `last_tier2:` — smoke-test
  will treat the first dup as a baseline-trigger and recommend a Tier-2
  baseline pass. Do **not** copy the upstream `.maintenance-log.yaml`
  from this repo; it is upstream-state, not a template.

## 2026-05-12 - rules/*.md categorization guidance in maintain-docs Step 3

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas: `templates/skill/workflows/maintain-docs.md`,
  `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md`
- Why it matters: Tier 2 § Step 3 "Categorize (before splitting)"
  previously described categorization only for entries-style files
  (gotchas / pitfalls — promote `**[topic]**` tags to H2 categories).
  For `rules/*.md`, which don't carry tags, the workflow gave no
  concrete recipe — agents crossing the Tier 2 trigger had to invent
  a grouping axis from scratch every time. Step 3 now distinguishes
  the two file types and articulates three common axes for
  `rules/*.md`: module / surface boundary, responsibility / lifecycle
  phase, and trigger scenario, with a "pick exactly one axis per file"
  constraint. Mixing axes is reframed as a split signal (Step 6), not
  a categorization signal. Single H2 growing past ~30 bullet-rules is
  the recommended sub-rule extraction threshold.
- Downstream refresh guidance: pull the updated
  `workflows/maintain-docs.md` as a mechanism-owned file. No migration
  required for existing rule files; the new guidance only fires when
  a `rules/*.md` crosses the Tier 2 bullet-rule trigger (> 25
  bullet-level rules) or when the user explicitly asks for cleanup.

## 2026-05-11 - Tiered maintenance triggers (bash gate / AAR scan / full pass)

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas: `templates/skill/workflows/update-rules.md`,
  `templates/skill/workflows/maintain-docs.md`, `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md`
- Why it matters: agent-led file cleanup costs tokens. Running the full
  reorganization scan on every commit, or every time anyone touches a
  gotchas file, would burn tokens without proportional benefit. The
  workflow now articulates a three-tier trigger discipline so the
  expensive scan runs only when cheap signals have already flagged
  something:
    - Tier 0 (bash, free, every commit): smoke-test `grep | uniq -d` on
      `gotchas.md` / `*pitfall*.md` `##` headings — catches verbatim
      copy-paste duplicates deterministically.
    - Tier 1 (agent, cheap, on every AAR closure that records a new
      entry): `update-rules.md § Search Before Record` upgraded to
      include a gotchas-specific scan recipe — list existing tags + ##
      headings via grep, then have the agent read 3–5 candidate entries
      and decide append / merge / skip. Cheap because the agent is
      already in context and only reads the candidate set, not the whole
      file.
    - Tier 2 (agent, expensive, threshold-triggered): full
      reorganization (dedup + categorize + split if needed). Only fires
      when entry count > 25, line count > 80% of cap, a recurring Tier-0
      dup signals drift, or the user explicitly asks. Expected cadence is
      "once or twice per file per year", not "every commit".
  `maintain-docs.md § Step 1b` was rewritten to make these triggers
  explicit (table + trigger list + token-cost intuition).
- Downstream refresh guidance: pull the updated `workflows/update-rules.md`
  and `workflows/maintain-docs.md` as mechanism-owned files. The Search
  Before Record block in `update-rules.md` now mandates the gotchas
  similarity scan at append time — agents already in AAR context should
  run the cheap grep recipe before appending to any pitfall file.

## 2026-05-11 - Gotchas dedup check + classification upgrade path

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas: `templates/skill/scripts/smoke-test.sh`,
  `templates/skill/references/gotchas.md`,
  `templates/skill/workflows/maintain-docs.md`,
  `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md`
- Why it matters: real-data audit of a downstream chaos_web pitfall log
  surfaced two problems the existing architecture did not catch:
  1. **Copy-paste duplicate entries**. The file had 4 entries whose `##`
     heading text matched another entry verbatim — same pitfall recorded
     twice because the author had no quick way to see "did I write this
     already?". The previous gotchas check only enforced line count,
     not duplicates. `smoke-test.sh § 2a` now grep-dedups `## ` headings
     in `gotchas.md` / `*pitfall*.md` and fails when any heading appears
     more than once. Deterministic check, very low false-positive rate.
  2. **No classification upgrade path**. The template `gotchas.md` told
     authors how to write one entry but said nothing about how to keep
     50 entries scannable. By the time a real file hits 25+ entries
     with no organization, finding "is this already recorded?" is O(file)
     and duplicates appear (see point 1). The template comment now
     teaches a three-stage upgrade: stage 1 flat with `**[topic]**` tags
     (≤ 10 entries), stage 2 H2 categories with `###` entries (10–25),
     stage 3 split files (> 25 or > 400 lines). `maintain-docs.md
     Step 1b` was reordered to enforce the same pipeline: dedup →
     staleness → **categorize before splitting** → structural → tag →
     split as last resort. Result: existing files reorganize before
     splitting prematurely, and new files start with the right structural
     instinct.
- Downstream refresh guidance: pull the updated `scripts/smoke-test.sh`,
  `references/gotchas.md` (template-side; **do not overwrite a downstream
  copy that already has real entries**, just port the new comment block
  to it), and `workflows/maintain-docs.md` as mechanism-owned files.
  After the refresh, run `smoke-test.sh <name>` — if you have copy-paste
  duplicates in your gotchas/pitfall files, the new check will list them
  and you can dedup in one pass. If your gotchas file is > 10 entries,
  follow `maintain-docs.md § Step 1b` to categorize before any split.

## 2026-05-09 - SKILL.md dual budget + test-trigger per-source rates

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas: `templates/skill/scripts/smoke-test.sh`,
  `templates/skill/scripts/check-growth-health.sh`,
  `templates/skill/scripts/test-trigger.sh`,
  `templates/skill/workflows/maintain-docs.md`,
  `templates/skill/conformance.yaml`,
  `templates/README.md`, `references/progressive-rigor.md`,
  `references/conventions.md`, `SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `CODEX.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `EXAMPLES.md`,
  `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md`
- Why it matters: closes two diagnostic gaps surfaced when auditing real
  downstream skills.
  1. **SKILL.md dual budget.** A single 100-line cap forced description
     quality to cannibalize body clarity (or vice versa) — when a skill
     wrote a proper 15-line description with quoted trigger phrases, body
     budget shrank to 85 lines and forced cramped routing tables. The
     budget now splits into description ≤ 25 lines (activation gate) +
     body ≤ 90 lines (navigation hub), enforced separately by
     `smoke-test.sh` and reported separately by `check-growth-health.sh`.
     Total cap effectively rises from 100 to 115, but each half has its
     own discipline — description can't bloat past 25 by stuffing
     workflow keywords, body can't bloat past 90 by inlining rule content.
  2. **test-trigger.sh per-source rates.** The script now reports
     trigger rate broken down by source (description quoted phrases vs.
     routing.yaml trigger_examples vs. Common Tasks vs. body candidates),
     not just one combined number. A large description-vs-routing gap
     (≥ 30 points) flags that the description is missing whole task
     categories the routing.yaml introduces — the most common cause of
     low real-world activation rates. Real-data example: chaos showed
     overall 69% but split into description 100% / routing 50% — the
     gap pointed straight at six trigger categories (plan / model / docs
     / upstream / rule-maintenance / fallback) that lived in routing.yaml
     but never made it into the description.
- Downstream refresh guidance: pull the updated `scripts/smoke-test.sh`,
  `scripts/check-growth-health.sh`, `scripts/test-trigger.sh`, and
  `workflows/maintain-docs.md` as mechanism-owned files. After the
  refresh:
  - Re-run `smoke-test.sh <name>` — your SKILL.md may previously have been
    a single-budget pass; if description was already ≤ 25 lines, the
    dual budget will still pass.
  - Re-run `test-trigger.sh <name>` — the per-source rates surface
    coverage gaps that the single number used to hide. A description ≤
    20% trigger rate against routing.yaml entries is the smoking-gun
    signal for the chaos-shaped gap.

## 2026-05-09 - test-trigger.sh body-candidate scan

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas: `templates/skill/scripts/test-trigger.sh`,
  `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md`
- Why it matters: when a skill keeps trigger phrases inside SKILL.md body
  (e.g. executable-style Tier-2 routes with `positive_signals:` lists)
  instead of in the frontmatter description / routing.yaml / Common Tasks,
  the previous `test-trigger.sh` couldn't extract anything and silently
  bailed with "No test prompts could be generated". Activation analysis
  effectively gave up. The script now:
  1. Always scans the body for quoted candidate trigger phrases, labeled
     with their nearest preceding heading.
  2. In static-analysis mode reports those candidates and flags the
     promotion gap (description has 0 phrases but body has N → promote).
  3. In live `claude -p` mode, when description / routing.yaml / Common
     Tasks together yield zero prompts, prints the body candidates as
     promotion advice instead of failing silently.
  4. Accepts `--include-body` to feed those body candidates into the
     trigger test as-if-promoted, measuring potential trigger rate after
     promotion (vs. current rate).
  Standard skill layouts (description + routing.yaml + Common Tasks) are
  unchanged — body extraction runs in addition, not instead.
- Downstream refresh guidance: pull the updated
  `skills/<name>/scripts/test-trigger.sh` as a mechanism-owned file. No
  workflow text changes; no breaking changes for existing skills.

## 2026-05-09 - Backward-compatible refresh guards

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas: `templates/skill/scripts/sync-routing.sh`,
  `templates/skill/workflows/update-upstream.md`, `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md`
- Why it matters: closes two refresh gaps that affect downstream projects
  scaffolded before the recent template trims:
  1. `sync-routing.sh` was changed to stop generating `.codex/instructions.md`
     when the recent commits made `.codex/` optional. That left existing
     downstream copies with stale routing blocks that would never auto-update.
     The script now keeps `.codex/instructions.md` in its target list **only
     when the file already exists** — old downstream skills keep getting
     synced; new scaffolds don't introduce the file.
  2. `update-upstream.md` had no explicit step for "scan upstream for new
     mechanism files that don't exist locally". When upstream introduced
     `conformance.yaml`, `check-version-conformance.sh`, and
     `_parse_conformance.py`, downstream agents could miss them entirely
     unless they happened to compare directory listings. A new step 5 now
     requires that scan before the per-file compare loop, with whole-file
     copy permitted under the existing Hard Rule #4 for missing files.
- Downstream refresh guidance: pull the updated `sync-routing.sh` and
  `update-upstream.md` as mechanism-owned files. Re-run
  `update-upstream.md` step 5 against your skill — it will surface any
  upstream mechanism files you don't yet have (most projects will need
  to copy `conformance.yaml`, `check-version-conformance.sh`, and
  `_parse_conformance.py` if they haven't yet).

## 2026-05-09 - Bloat reduction across templates, references, examples, READMEs

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas: 33 files. Deletions:
  `templates/migration/` (entire dir — `migrate.sh`, `resume.sh`, README),
  `templates/checklists/post-migration.md`,
  `templates/protocol-blocks/iron-law-header.md`,
  `templates/shells/.codex/instructions.md`, `.codex/instructions.md` (root),
  `examples/{migration,project-types,self-evolution,README}.md`.
  Major slims: `WORKFLOW.md` (-160 lines, removed migration FSM),
  `README.md` + `README.zh-CN.md` (-296 lines combined),
  `references/layout.md` (-167 lines, split out three new files),
  `references/thin-shells.md` (-141 lines, per-tool moved out).
  New references: `references/{progressive-rigor,positioning,per-tool-shells}.md`.
  Major rewrite: `EXAMPLES.md` (now consolidated body, was a stub).
  Mechanism updates: `scripts/sync-self-routing.sh` and
  `templates/skill/scripts/sync-routing.sh` no longer generate
  `.codex/instructions.md`; `smoke-test.sh` makes `.codex/instructions.md`
  optional instead of required; `examples/README.md` route in
  `references/self-hosting-routing.yaml` repointed to `EXAMPLES.md` +
  `examples/behavior-failures.md`.
  Net: +476 / −2117 lines.
- Why it matters: removed mechanisms that solved problems that don't
  recur — the migration state machine for crashes that don't happen, the
  duplicate Codex shell for harnesses that all read `AGENTS.md`, four
  long examples files that no route ever activated, the reusable
  `iron-law-header` block that was referenced once. Split two oversized
  references (`layout.md`, `thin-shells.md`) so routing pulls only the
  relevant subsection. The architecture's own "small focused files"
  principle now applies to itself.
- Downstream refresh guidance: when running `update-upstream`, expect to
  delete several files in your downstream skill if you scaffolded from a
  prior upstream:
  - Delete `skills/$NAME/.codex/instructions.md` if your harness does not
    explicitly read it (most don't — `AGENTS.md` is canonical).
    `smoke-test.sh` no longer requires it.
  - If your downstream copied `templates/migration/`, `templates/checklists/`,
    or `templates/protocol-blocks/iron-law-header.md`, remove them — they
    are no longer maintained upstream.
  - Old long-form example files were consolidated into root `EXAMPLES.md`.
    `examples/behavior-failures.md` is the only example file kept.
  - For inbound links to former `references/layout.md` sections,
    repoint: `#progressive-rigor` → `progressive-rigor.md`,
    `#multi-skill-projects` → `multi-skill-routing.md` (Coexistence rules),
    Positioning section → `positioning.md`.
  - For inbound links to former `references/thin-shells.md § Per-Tool …`,
    repoint to `references/per-tool-shells.md`.

## 2026-05-09 - Wire conformance into the check suite + self-hosting parity

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas: `scripts/check-all.sh`,
  `templates/skill/workflows/update-upstream.md`,
  `references/self-hosting-conformance.yaml` (new),
  `references/README.md`, `scripts/README.md`, `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md`
- Why it matters: closes three follow-on gaps that were left by the previous
  conformance commit:
  1. The conformance check shipped without being wired into `check-all.sh` —
     it was a "stored but not activated" tool (Pitfall #4 in `SKILL.md`).
     Now `check-all.sh` runs both the template manifest and the new
     self-hosting manifest before commit/push.
  2. The downstream `update-upstream` workflow ran the local
     `conformance.yaml` (a snapshot from initial scaffold), which silently
     re-validates against an old contract whenever upstream bumps required
     sections. The workflow now mandates running the check against
     `$tmp/upstream/templates/skill/conformance.yaml` (the live upstream
     contract) and only after passing may the local manifest be overwritten
     as a mechanism-owned file.
  3. The upstream repo itself was outside the conformance net — it is
     self-hosting and has no `workflows/` folder, so the template manifest
     could not validate it. The new
     `references/self-hosting-conformance.yaml` asserts the upstream's
     canonical files (`SKILL.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`, `TEMPLATES-GUIDE.md`,
     `references/protocols.md`) still teach the protocols its templates
     promise downstream — Task Closure Protocol, AAR, Recording Threshold,
     Activation Check, Generalization Rule, Progressive Rigor, etc.
  Additionally `scripts/README.md` now carries a Check Suite Matrix so
  maintainers can answer "which check covers which gap" without reading
  every script header.
- Downstream refresh guidance: when running `update-upstream`, follow the
  updated step 9 (run conformance against the upstream clone's manifest, not
  the local one). Treat `conformance.yaml` and `_parse_conformance.py` as
  mechanism-owned — overwrite them from upstream after a successful refresh.
  Do NOT copy `references/self-hosting-conformance.yaml` or `check-all.sh`
  into downstream projects; they are upstream-only maintenance assets.

## 2026-05-09 - Content conformance manifest + check script

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas: `templates/skill/conformance.yaml` (new),
  `templates/skill/scripts/check-version-conformance.sh` (new),
  `templates/skill/scripts/_parse_conformance.py` (new),
  `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md`
- Why it matters: adds a content-presence check that complements the existing
  guardrails. `check-upstream-changes.sh` enforces a downstream-impact note,
  `sync-routing.sh --check` keeps routing tables in sync, `smoke-test.sh`
  enforces structural budgets, `check-self-scenarios.sh` proves trigger
  routing, and `check-growth-health.sh` reports growth pressure. None of
  those validate that a downstream skill actually carries the workflow
  sections an upstream upgrade just shipped (Task Closure Protocol,
  Generalization Rule, Question Gate A/B/C, the dossier-folder block, and so
  on). The new manifest closes that gap: each commit IS the version, and
  `check-version-conformance.sh <skill-root>` asserts the listed sections /
  phrases / files all exist. Default manifest path is
  `<skill-root>/conformance.yaml`; downstream skills get a copy when they
  scaffold from `templates/skill/`. Upstream self-check:
  `bash templates/skill/scripts/check-version-conformance.sh templates/skill`.
- Downstream refresh guidance: when running `update-upstream`, after the
  existing routing sync and smoke test, run the conformance check on your
  skill root. If it reports missing sections, the upstream upgrade is
  incomplete — re-apply the missing template content before declaring the
  refresh done. Do NOT add `version:` fields to `conformance.yaml`; each
  upstream commit is the version, and downstream pulls the latest manifest
  from the upstream clone.

## 2026-05-08 - Architecture governance follow-through

- Upstream commit: pending in this working tree
- Changed areas: `templates/skill/workflows/profile-project.md`,
  `references/layout.md`, `references/executable-skill-architecture.md`,
  `references/scenario-testing.md`, `TEMPLATES-GUIDE.md`,
  `references/protocols.md`, `templates/skill/workflows/update-rules.md`,
  `templates/README.md`, `templates/skill/scripts/check-growth-health.sh`,
  `templates/skill/scripts/audit-route-paths.sh`,
  `scripts/check-self-scenarios.sh`, `scripts/check-all.sh`, `README.md`,
  `README.zh-CN.md`, `skill.yaml`, and `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md`
- Why it matters: turns the architecture review into concrete governance:
  project profiling now uses separate structure / execution / topology axes,
  growth pressure is reported without failing by default, Task Closure has one
  canonical source, references can be audited by route path, and the
  self-hosting repo has minimal scenario checks for high-risk routing.
- Downstream refresh guidance: port the three-axis `profile-project` changes
  and the new report scripts if the downstream skill is starting to grow. Keep
  `check-growth-health.sh` and `audit-route-paths.sh` report-first unless the
  downstream project has stable thresholds. Do not copy
  `scripts/check-self-scenarios.sh`; it is upstream self-hosting validation.

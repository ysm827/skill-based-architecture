# Fix Bug Workflow

> **Inline by default.** Delegate only after [`subagent-driven.md` § Delegation Admission Gate](subagent-driven.md#delegation-admission-gate) proves an independent workstream, real overlap, and positive Net Benefit. A grep, single test, command, or narrow edit is not a worker by default.

## Mandatory Pre-Step (cannot skip)

**Re-run `SKILL.md` § Session Discipline before starting.** Re-match this bug against Common Tasks; re-read the route's files only if the route changed or context was compacted (see § Session Discipline).

**Root-cause-first gate:** no fix before the root cause is identified — the *actual* cause, not the first plausible one. A fix applied to a symptom you haven't traced is a guess; if it's wrong you've added a second bug on top of the first. (Backstop: § Three Strikes — if three fixes fail, the premise itself is wrong.)

## Read First

1. Re-open `SKILL.md` → match this bug to a Common Tasks route
2. Read the route's core files only if needed by Session Discipline; then apply `references/minimal-sufficient-context.md`
3. Expand to `references/gotchas.md`, source indexes, callers, or extra rules only when root-cause work hits an expansion signal

## Steps

1. Restate the bug scope and affected behavior
2. Read the minimum necessary files; re-enter `references/minimal-sufficient-context.md` if ownership, callers, contracts, or runtime dependencies become unclear
3. **Reproduce first** — express the bug as a repeatable check (a failing test, a script, or a written manual sequence) and confirm it fails *for the reported reason* before touching code. If it passes or fails differently, fix the reproduction or your acceptance understanding first. Can't be automated → write the repeatable manual steps + why not.
4. Identify the root cause — not the first plausible cause, the actual one. **If 2+ plausible hypotheses survive a 30-second think**, see § Hypothesis Fan-out below before reading more code.
5. Implement the smallest correct fix — no "while we're here" cleanups
6. Run Fix Impact Analysis — confirm the change did not silently break callers, data flow, or compatibility
7. Validate: **the same check from step 3 now passes** (fresh evidence — red before, green after; swapping in a different check re-opens the false-green door), plus the smallest relevant regression per Fix Impact Analysis. Run the narrow check inline when its result is the next decision. A long independent test/build may be delegated only when real main-thread work continues concurrently; never spawn it and then wait.
8. **Run Task Closure Protocol** from `workflows/task-closure.md` — mandatory, not optional
9. If the recording threshold passes, update the appropriate `rules/`, `references/`, or `workflows/` file before ending the task
10. Records must pass the generalization check — write as reusable knowledge, not project-specific narratives
11. If the lesson is costly and task-relevant, also activate it in workflow/routing, not only store in `references/`

## Hypothesis Fan-out (optional, for ambiguous bugs)

When the first read leaves 2+ plausible root causes still alive, serial elimination is the wrong strategy — by the time hypothesis #4 hits, the main context is polluted with three rabbit holes.

**Trigger** — fan out only when **all** of:

- ≥ 2 hypotheses are concrete enough to be a single-sentence claim
- Each one can be **independently verified** by reading a different region of the codebase / a different log slice / a different external check
- Inspecting them all in one context would consume > 30% of remaining budget
- Parallel verdicts save more than contract, review, and integration cost

If any condition fails, just inline the most likely one. Fan-out has dispatch overhead.

**How to fan out** — for each hypothesis, dispatch one subagent (per `workflows/subagent-orchestration.md` Phase 1 contract format):

- **Goal**: confirm or refute the claim "*<single-sentence hypothesis>*"
- **Inputs**: the specific files / logs / endpoints that would prove or disprove it (do not pass the bug description as a whole — pass only the slice that matters for this hypothesis)
- **Outputs**: a short verdict — "confirmed (evidence: …)" / "refuted (evidence: …)" / "inconclusive (need: …)"
- **Forbidden Zones**: any file edit; this is read-only investigation
- **Acceptance Criteria**: the verdict cites at least one specific file:line or log line as evidence

If the Delegation Admission Gate still passes, dispatch the minimum independent hypotheses in parallel. Worker count cannot exceed the hypotheses that are actually independent. The main agent prepares synthesis/acceptance work while they run; if every remaining path then depends on verdicts, use one bounded wait rather than polling.

**Degraded harness (Cursor / Codex / Gemini)**: skip the literal dispatch, but still write down the list of hypotheses + the verification region for each before reading code. The discipline of "decide what would refute each, before reading" survives even without subagents.

## Three Strikes — stop and question the architecture

If **three distinct fixes** have failed to resolve the same bug, stop — do not attempt a fourth patch. Three misses is not bad luck; it means the model of the problem is wrong. One of these is almost always true:

- **The root cause is not where you think.** You have been fixing a symptom; the real trigger is upstream. Re-trace from the actual call origin, not the error site.
- **The architecture is forcing the bug.** The design makes this class of error reachable; the durable fix is structural, not another patch.
- **A hidden assumption is false.** A "can't happen" invariant is happening — stale cache, race, wrong environment, shadowed config.

Write down what each of the three attempts assumed and why it failed; the contradiction usually points straight at the wrong assumption. Re-question the premise before any further attempt — and if the durable fix is now a structural change rather than the small fix the task assumed, surface that to the user instead of forcing a fourth patch.

## Fix Impact Analysis

Before final validation, inspect the actual diff and answer:

1. **Direct impact** — Which callers use the changed function/method/component? Did any parameter signature, return type, response shape, or error behavior change?
2. **Indirect impact** — Does the fix alter upstream/downstream data flow, shared state, global config, cache behavior, event timing, listeners, callbacks, or async ordering?
3. **Data compatibility** — If fields were added, removed, renamed, or changed type, do old data, persisted data, API consumers, and fallback/default paths still work?
4. **Blast-radius validation** — Which targeted tests, compile checks, type checks, or manual smoke paths cover the affected callers and compatibility assumptions?

If any answer is unknown, inspect the relevant callers or data contracts before declaring the fix safe.

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] Root cause identified (not just a plausible-looking fix)
- [ ] If three fixes failed, the premise / architecture was re-questioned (not a fourth symptom patch)
- [ ] Fix Impact Analysis completed against the actual diff
- [ ] Direct callers and changed signatures/return shapes checked
- [ ] Indirect data flow, shared state, events, callbacks, and async timing considered
- [ ] Data compatibility checked for added/removed/renamed/type-changed fields
- [ ] Code fix verified (the step-3 check flipped red → green; manual repro clean)
- [ ] Task Closure Protocol was run (AAR scan completed before declaring task done)
- [ ] Recording threshold checked
- [ ] If threshold passed, record passes generalization check and docs updated
- [ ] If the lesson was costly and task-relevant, it was activated in workflow/routing, not only stored in `references/`

## Final Report (to the user)

Close with these five fields — the checklist above is the agent's gate; this is what the user reads:

- **Root cause** — the actual cause; name any residual uncertainty
- **Change** — what behavior changed and the key files; no unrelated diff walk-through
- **Verification** — which check failed before and passed after (step 3 → step 7), and what regression ran
- **Blast radius** — callers / contracts / data compatibility / async effects, per Fix Impact Analysis
- **Uncovered risk** — what was not verified and why; anything needing user sign-off

<!-- OPTIONAL: add project-specific validation steps here — e.g. specific test suites to run, linters, smoke tests; declare the cheapest-sufficient verification path (e.g. hot-reload dev server) and what triggers escalation to a full build. -->

# Fix Bug Workflow

Use this route to determine whether observed behavior is an implementation defect and, if so, prove a semantically complete repair. For a non-Simple task, [`task-execution.md`](task-execution.md) turns these domain steps into the current Task Anchor and Native Plan without weakening the gates below. Read [`subagent-auxiliary.md`](subagent-auxiliary.md) only for an admitted independent investigation or long result-only check.

## Mandatory Pre-Step

Re-match the task route. No patch before expected behavior and the actual root cause are established.

**Design-or-defect gate:** when behavior depends on business semantics, compare the routed business model, architecture/contracts, and code/tests/runtime. Classify:

- `IMPLEMENTATION_BUG` — implementation violates the current model/contract;
- `DESIGN_CHANGE` — the requested result changes a business type, flow direction, state machine, or core invariant, or moves a stable business boundary;
- `INSUFFICIENT_BUSINESS_CONTEXT` — evidence cannot establish intended behavior.

A Design Change leaves this workflow for an approved Plan. For insufficient context, search evidence first and ask only the missing macro question; a completely absent model is created only if the user chooses “now”. Obvious technical failures need no business model.

## Steps

1. Restate the observed behavior, affected scope, and expected result.
2. Classify with the Design-or-defect gate.
3. Reproduce the defect with a failing automated check for the reported reason; if automation is impossible, give repeatable manual steps and why.
4. Trace the real root cause. Identify the violated invariant, state ownership/provenance, producer-to-consumer call chain, and every affected full/incremental/read/write path. If several independent hypotheses survive and delegation has positive Net Benefit, use `subagent-auxiliary.md`; synthesis stays with the main agent.
5. Apply the **Repair-depth gate** — default to Product Development and repair the invariant-owning boundary, including coordinated multi-layer changes when required. Use Operational Stabilization only for an explicit production/availability/frozen-scope constraint; containment must be reversible and leave the structural repair visibly unresolved.
6. Implement the smallest semantically complete repair; dependency count increases validation duty but cannot veto the correct boundary. Avoid unrelated cleanup.
7. Inspect direct and indirect consumers plus changed contracts, data compatibility, shared state/config, events, and async ordering. Resolve any unknown that could invalidate the fix.
8. Run the same acceptance check to green and the smallest relevant regression across every affected path. Escalate to runtime/release evidence only when the changed behavior requires it.
9. Run the [Task Closure Protocol](task-closure.md). Record only a lesson that passes its gates and has an action-changing route.

After three failed approaches, stop and report the attempts and false premise instead of trying a fourth variant.

## Completion Check

- Classification and design basis are explicit.
- The failing check reproduced the real defect before code changed and passes afterward.
- Invariant ownership, call chain, all affected paths, direct/indirect impact, compatibility, and residual uncertainty were inspected.
- Product Development vs Operational Stabilization was selected from task evidence, not implementation convenience.
- No type/flow/state/invariant change was smuggled through Bug Fix.
- Task Closure ran once after the integrated fix.

## Final Report

Report classification/design basis, root cause, change, red→green verification, blast radius, and uncovered risk. Do not narrate the whole diff.

# Agent Behavior — Meta (origin, admission, activation audit)

Read this when **editing** `rules/agent-behavior.md` (e.g. on the `update-rules` route) — not on every task. It holds the documentation-about-the-rule that has no per-task runtime value, kept out of the Always-Read floor so every downstream session pays less.

## Origin

Principles 1, 3, and 4 condensed from [forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills](https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills) (Andrej Karpathy's observations on LLM coding pitfalls, 2025). Principle 2 replaces Simplicity First after repeated surface-patch failures showed that minimal-disturbance defaults can preserve availability while violating ownership and cross-path invariants; minimality now applies only after semantic completeness, with an explicit Operational Stabilization exception. Principle 5 combines [OthmanAdi/planning-with-files](https://github.com/OthmanAdi/planning-with-files) with this project's Task Anchor, harness-native Plan, scope, permission, evidence, and Goodhart boundaries; principle 6 comes from the recorded spawn-then-wait failure in [`behavior-failures.md`](behavior-failures.md); principle 7 comes from this project's response-discipline rule.

## Admission Threshold for New Principles

Before adding a new principle to `rules/agent-behavior.md`, read the admission threshold in `templates/ANTI-TEMPLATES.md § Admission Threshold for Behavioral Principles`. The file is capped at 100 lines; growth requires evidence of a real miss (an AAR row or a `behavior-failures.md` entry) or an equal-weight replacement — not borrowing from an admired project.

## Observable Signals — Is This Working?

These defaults are being activated (not just stored) if diffs and sessions show:

- **Fewer drive-by changes** — every changed line traces to the request; no style churn, renaming, or dead-code deletion that wasn't asked for.
- **Invariant-complete repairs** — ownership and producer-to-consumer paths are traced before repair depth is chosen; full and incremental paths preserve the same filter/contract, and immutable state is changed at its owning boundary instead of mutated by a downstream consumer.
- **Clarifying questions come before code, not after mistakes** — ambiguity is surfaced at the start of a turn, not during cleanup two iterations in.
- **Shorter first drafts** — simple implementations that grow only when real pressure forces them; no speculative flags, strategy classes, or config for one-use code.
- **Proportional, repeated goal anchoring without Simple-task ceremony** — Managed tasks establish Goal and Done When, use natural-language alignment by default, avoid duplicating a visible Native Plan, and reserve a structured task brief for complex or scope-sensitive work; compact Anchor Checkpoints still run internally before each main step and after correction/failure/interruption; no planning files are created.
- **Exploration converges without score chasing** — necessary discovery remains open until its decision point; rankings and process metrics prompt scrutiny but never replace outcome evidence or become the objective.
- **Fewer workers and no idle main thread** — small steps stay inline; every dispatch names concurrent main-thread work; worker count follows independent workstreams, and repeated wait polling disappears.

If none of these signals appear across several sessions, the defaults are stored but not activated. Log the incident in [`behavior-failures.md`](behavior-failures.md) rather than re-reading the rule again — storage without activation is itself a tracked failure mode, not a reminder problem.
